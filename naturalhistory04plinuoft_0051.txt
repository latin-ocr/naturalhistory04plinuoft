by the calculation of Eratosthenes a schoenus measures
40 furlongs, that is five miles, but some authorities
have made the schoenus 32 furlongs. There are hills
rising to a great height, with natural forests on
them running right down to the level ground. It
is generally agreed that the soil is clay, and that
there are few springs and these charged with alkali.
Adjacent to the Astramitae is another district,
the Minaei, through whose territory the transit for
the export of the frankincense is along one narrow

track. It was these people who originated the trade “²⁶

and who chiefly practise it, and from them the per-
fume takes the name of ‘ Minaean '; none of the
Arabs beside these have ever seen an incense-tree,
and not even all of these, and it is said that there are
not more than 3000 families who retain the right of
trading in it as a hereditary property, and that conse-
quently the members of these families are called sacred,
and are not allowed to be polluted by ever meeting
women or funeral processions when they are engaged
in making incisions in the trees in order to obtain the
frankincense‚ and that in this way the price of the com-
modity is increased owing to scruples of religion. Some
persons report that the frankincense in the forests be-
longs to all these peoples in common, but others state
that it is shared out among them in yearly turns.
XXXI. Nor is there agreement in regard to the ap-
pearance of the incense-tree itself. W'e have carried
on operations in Arabia, and the arms of Rome have
penetrated into a large part of it; indeed, Gaius
Caesar, son of Augustus, won great renown from the
country3 yet no Latin writer, so far as I know, has
described the appearance of this tree. The descrip-
tions given by the Greeks vary: some have stated
