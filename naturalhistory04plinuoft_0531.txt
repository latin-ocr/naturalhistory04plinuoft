with the rest of the timber used, and it lasted till
the amphitheatre of the emperor Nero.‘¹ It was a
log of larchwood, 120 feet long and of 3 uniform
thickness of two feet, from which could be inferred
the almost incredible height of the rest of the tree
by calculating its length to the top. Within our
own memory there was also an equally marvellous
tree left by Marcus Agrippa in the porticos of the
Voting-booths, left over from the timber used for
the ballot office3 this was twenty feet shorter than
the one previously mentioned, and 18 inches in
thickness. An especially wonderful fir was seen
in the ship which brought from Egypt at the order
of the emperor Gaius the obelisk erected in the
Vatican Circus and four shafts of the same stone to
serve as its base. It is certain that nothing· more
wonderful than this ship has ever been seen on the
sea: it carried one hundred and twenty bushels of
lentils for ballast, and its length took up a large part
of the left side of the harbour of Ostia, for under
the emperor Claudius it was sunk there, with three
moles as high as towers erected upon it that had been
made of Pozzuoli cernent for the purpose and con-
veyed to the place. It took four men to span the
girth of this tree with their arms; and we commonly
hear that masts for those purposes cost 80 ‚000
sesterces and more, and that to put together the rafts

usually runs to 40‚OOO. But in Egypt and Syria Tre ror
