and also one is recorded as belonging to Gallus
Asinius that cost a million. Also two hanging tables
were sold at auction by King J uba, of which one
fetched 1,200‚OOO sesterces and the other a little less.
A table that was lately destroyed in a fire came down
from the Cethegi and had changed hands at 1,300,000
sesterces—the price of a large estate, supposing
somebody preferred to devote so large a sum to the
purchase oflanded property. The size of the largest
tables hitherto has been: one made by Ptolemy,
king of Mauretania, out of two semicircular slabs of
wood joined together, 4} ft. in diameter and 3 in. thick
—and the invisibility of the join makes the table more
marvellous as a work of art than it could possibly have
been if a product of nature—and a single slab bear-
ing the name of Nomius a freedman of the Emperor
which is 3 ft. 11} in. across and ll} in. thick. Under
this head it seems proper to include a table that be-
longed to the Emperor Tiberius which was 4 ft. 24¹- in.
across, and 1} in. thick all over, but was only covered
with a veneer of citrus-wood, although the one
belonging to his freedman Nomius was so sumptuous.
The material is an excrescence of the root, and is
very greatly admired when it grows entirely under-
ground, and so is more uncommon than the knobs
that grow above ground, on the branches as well as on
the trunk3 and the timber bought at so high a price
is in reality a disease of the trees, the size and the
roots of which can be judged from the circular- table-
tops. In foliage, scent and the appearance of the
trunk these trees resemble the female cypress, which
is also a forest tree. A mountain called Ancorarius
in Hither Mauretania provided the most celebrated
citrus-wood, but the supply is now exhausted.
