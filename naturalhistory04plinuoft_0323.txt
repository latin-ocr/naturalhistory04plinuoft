BOOK XV. vn. 31—V111. 34

The most approved kind comes from the Bruttian
land3 the pitch there is very rich and full of resin.
The colour of pitch-oil is reddish yellow. There is an
oil that grows of its own accord in the coastal parts
of Syria called elaeomeli.‘¹ Itis a rich oil that trickles
from trees, of a substance thicker than honey but
thinner than resin, and having a sweet flavour3 this
also is used by the doctors. There is also a use of
old olive-oil for certain kinds of diseases, and it is
also deemed to be serviceable for preserving ivory
from decay : at all events, the inside of the statue of
Saturn at Rome has been filled with oil.

VIII. But it is above all to the lees of olive-oil that uses os
Cato has devoted his praises: he tells how vats and fffflffixx,
casks to hold oil are steeped in lees to prevent their XCI-ff·
soaking up the oil; how threshing-floors are given a
dressing of lees to keep away ants and to prevent
cracks; and moreover how the clay of the walls and
the plaster and flooring of granaries, and even cup-
boards for clothes, are sprinkled with lees, and how
seed-corn is steeped in them, as a protection
against wood-worms and inj urious insects. He speaks
of its use as a remedy for diseases of animals and also
of trees, and also as a specific against ulceration of
the mouth in human beings. He says that reins and
all leather articles, and shoes and the axles of wheels
are greased with boiled lees, and so are copper
vessels to keep off verdigris and to give them a
more attractive colour, and all wooden utensils and
earthenware jars used for keeping dried figs in, or
it may be sprays of myrtle with their leaves and
berries on them or anything else of a similar kind.
Finally he states that logs of wood steeped in olive-
lees will burn without any annoying smoke.
