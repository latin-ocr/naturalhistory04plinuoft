and bud earlier, and are in advance of the season
generally3 and in general all attention adds fertility,
while fertility advances old age, because every
weakness is rendered more subject to the weather.

LII. Many trees grow several products, as we said onm-
in the case of acorn-bearing trees. Among them, the {Jffiffjssust
laurel bears its own grapes,‘² and especially the barren §5 20 ff·
laurel, which produces nothing else, and which is
consequently thought by some people to be the
male tree. Hazels also bear catkins of a hard, com-
pact shape, which are of no use for any purpose3
but the holm-oak ὸ produces the greatest number
of things, for it grows both its own seed and the grain
called crataegus,⁰ and mistletoe grows on the north
side of the tree and hyphear on the south side—we
shall say more about these a little later—and oc-§245·
casionally the trees have all four of these things

LIII. Some trees are of simple shape, having one QZ& Οἱς,
stem rising from the root and a number of branches, trees. ⁹
as the olive, fig and vine3 some belong to the bushy
class, as the Christ's thorn and the myrtle, and
also the hazel—in fact this bears better and more
abundant nuts when it spreads out into many
branches. Some trees have no branches at all, for
instance the box of the cultivated variety and the
foreign lotus. Some trees are forked, and even
branch out into five parts, some divide the trunk
but have no branches, as is the case with the elder,
and some are undivided and have branches, like the
pitch-pines. Some have their branches in a regular
order, for instance the pitch-pine, the fir, with
others their arrangement is irregular, as with the oak,

apple and pear. Also in the case of the fir the
