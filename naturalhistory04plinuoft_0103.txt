kind that comes from India is valued more highly3

with a scent stronger than that of saffron, a darkish
rough appearance, and a sort of salt taste. The
white variety is less highly spoken of ; it very quickly

but already beginning to change colour—the differ-

plucked when the grapes are the size of a chick-pea,
before the rising of the Dog-star‚ when the first
bloom is on them, and the unripe juice is obtained;
after which the remaining pulp is left to dry in
the sun—precaution being taken against nocturnal
dews, by storing the grapes in an earthenware
vessel—while the unripe juice is collected and at
once also put to keep in a Cyprian bronze Jar. The
best kind is that which is red in colour and rather
