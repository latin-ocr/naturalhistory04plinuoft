principate of Gaius Caesar, son of Germanicus, 160 An. 39.
years after the consulship of Opimius, the wine cost
that amount for one-twelfth of an amphora—this
appears in our biography‘ of the bard Pomponius
Secundus and the banquet that he gave to the
emperor mentioned : so large are the sums of money
that are kept stored in our wine-cellars! Indecd
there is nothing else which experiences a greater in-
crease of value up to the twentieth year—or a greater

fall in value afterwards, supposing that there is not

a rise of price.⁶ Rarely indeed has it occurred
hitherto and only in the case of some spendthrift’s
extravagance, for wine to fetch a thousand sesterces

a cask. It is believed that the people of Vienne
alone sell their wines flavoured with pitch‚ the
varieties of which we have specis-led, for a higherils·
price, though out of patriotism they only sell it
among themselves; and this wine when drunk cold

is believed to be cooler than all the other kinds.

VII. VVine has the property of heating the parts of Physiolofflscal

the body inside when it is drunk and of cooling thern efs⁶⁶t⁰s²⁰‘'‘e'
when poured on them outside. And it will not be
out ofplace to recall here what the famous philosopher
Androcydes wrote to Alexander the Great in an
attempt to restrain his intemperance: ‘ When you
are about to drink wine, O King, remember that you
are drinking the earth’s blood. Hemlock is poison
to a human being and wine is poison to hemlock.'
If Alexander had obeyed this advice, doubtless he
would not have killed his friends⁶ in his drunken
fits; so that in fact we are justified in saying that
there is nothing else that is more useful for strength-
ening the body, and also nothing more detrimental
to our pleasures⁶ if moderatiori be lacking.
