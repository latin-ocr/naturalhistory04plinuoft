BOOK XII. xxxv. 68-70

this comes the cultivated kind, and also the better
variety of the wild kind, the one tapped in summer.
No tithes are given to a god from myrrh, as it also
grows in other countries; however, the growers have
to pay a quarter of the yield to the king of the Geb-
banitae. For the rest it is bought up all over the
district from the common people and packed into
leather bags3 and our perfumiers have no difficulty
in distinguishing the different sorts by the evi-
dence of the scent and consistency. There are
a great many varieties, the first among the wild V<1⁷i2²ie³ ο]
kinds being the Cave—divellet myrrh, next the 'mm ’
Minaean, which includes the Astramitic, Gebbanitic
and Ausaritic from the kingdom of the Gebbanitae;
the third quality is the Dianite‚ the fourth a
mixture from various sources, the fifth the Sam-
bracene from a seaboard state in the kingdom of
the Sabaei, and the sixth the one called Dusirite.
There is also a white kind found in one place only,
which is brought into the town of Mesalum for sale.
The Cave-dweller kind is distinguished by its thickness
and because it is rather dry and dusty and foreign in
appearance, but has a stronger scent than the other
sorts. The Sambracene variety is advertised as sur-
passing other kinds in its agreeable quality, but it
has not a strong scent. Broadly speaking, however,
the proof of goodness is given by its being in small
pieces of irregular shape, forming in the solidifying
of the jujce as it turns white and dries up, and in
its showing white marks like finger-nails when it is
broken, and having a slightly bitter taste. The
second best kind is mottled inside‚ and the worst
is the one that is black inside3 and if it is black
outside as well it is of a still inferior quality.
