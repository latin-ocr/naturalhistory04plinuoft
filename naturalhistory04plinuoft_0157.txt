BOOK XIII. xxm. 76-xxw. 79

is the Saitic paper named from the town where it is
produced in the greatest abundance, being made from
shavings of inferior quality, and the Taeneotio‚ from a
neighbouring place, made from material still nearer
the outside skin,in the case of which we reach a variety
that is sold by mere weight and not for its quality.
As for what is called ‘ emporitic ' paper, it is no good
for writing but serves to provide covers for documents
and wrappers for merchandise‚ and consequently
takes its name from the Greek word for a merchant.
After this coines the actual papyrus, and its outer-
most layer, which resembles a rush and is of no use
even for making ropes except those used in water.

Paper of all kinds is ⁶ woven ' on a board moistened
with water from the Nile, muddy liquid supplying
the effect of glue. First an upright layer is smeared
on to the table, using the full length of papyrus
available after the trimmings have been cut off at
both ends, and afterwards cross strips complete the
lattice-work. The next step is to press it in presses,
and the sheets are dried in the sun and then joined
together, the next strip used always diminishing in
quality down to the worst of all. There are never
more than twenty sheets to a roll.

XXIV. There is a great difference in the breadth
of the various kinds of paper: the best is thirteen
inches wide, the hieratio two inches less, the Fannian
measures ten inches and the amphitheatre paper one
less, while the Saitic is still fewer inches across and
is not as wide as the mallet used in making it, as
the emporitic kind is so narrow that it does not
exceed six inches. Other points looked at in paper
are fineness, stoutness‚ whiteness and smoothness.
The status of best quality was altered by the
