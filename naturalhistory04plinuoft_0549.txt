reliable for things subjected to friction‚ for instance

the axles of wheels, for which ash is selected because

of its pliancy, as also is holm-oak for its hardness

and elm for both qualities. But wood is also used

in small pieces for the operations of earpentry, and a
remarkable fact stated is that the most serviceable
holders for augers are made from wild olive, box,
holm-oak‚ elm and ash, and the best mallets from

the same woods and larger ones from pine and
holm-Oak. But with these timbers also seasonable
felling is more conducive to strength than if done
prematurely, inasmuch as hinges made of olive,

a very hard wood, that have been left too long un-
moved in doorways have been known to put out shoots

like a growing plant. Cato recommends holly, Ru.
laurel or elm for making levers, and Hyginus horn· XXXI· ¹·
bearn, holm-oak or Turkey-oak for the hafts of
agricultural implements.

The principal woods for cutting into layers and Veaminq
for using as a veneer to cover other kinds of wood §erzlffffiy
are citrus, turpentine-tree, varieties of maple‚ box,
palm, holly, holm-oak, the root of the elder, and
poplar. Also the alder‚ as has been stated, supplies §6⁹-

a tuberosity that ean be out into layers, as do the
citrus and the maple; no other trees have tuberosi-
ties so much valued. The middle part of trees is
more variegated‚ and the nearer the root the smaller
and the more wavy are the markings. This first
originated the luxury use of trees, oovering up one
with another and making an outside skin for a cheaper
wood out of a more expensive one. In order that
one tree might be sold several times over, even thin
layers ⁰ of wood have been invented. And this was
not enough: the horns of animals began to be dyed
