BOOK XIII. lx. 42—46

this book was published. The actual fruit is large,
hard and prickly‚ and differs from all the other kinds
by having a gamey sort of smell that 1s most noticed
in wild boars, which 1s the reason for its name. The
sandalis date, so called from its resemblance to a
sandaL ranks fourth; of this kind again there are
said to be at the most five trees in existence, on the
border of Ethiopia, and they are as remarkable for
the sweetness of their fruit as they are for their
rarity. Next to these the most famous are the
caryotae, which supply a great deal of food but also
of juice, and from which the principa] wines of the
East are made3 these strongly affect the head, to
which the date owes its name.a But not only are these
trees abundant and bear largely in Judaea, but also
the most famous are found there, and not in the whole
of that country but specially in Jericho‚ although
those growing in the v alley 5 of Archelais and Phaselis
and Livias 1n the same countiy are also highly spoken
of. Their outstanding property is the unctuous juice
which they exude and an extremely sw eet sort of
wine-flav our like that of honey. The Nicholas dateb
belonging to this class is not so juicy but exceptionally
large in size, four put end to end making a length
of eighteen inches. The date that comes next in
sweetness is less attractive to look at, but in flavour
is the sister of the caryotae and consequently is
called in Greek the sister- datefi The third clas 55
among these, the pateta, has too copious a supply of
juice, and the excess of liquor of the fruit itself bursts
open even while on the parent tree, looking like dates
that have been trodden on.

Of the many drier dates the finger-date forms a
class of its own: it is a very long slender date,
