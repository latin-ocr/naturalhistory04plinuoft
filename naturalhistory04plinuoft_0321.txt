sesame and rice, and the Fish-eater tribes from fish.
Scarcity sometimes compels people to make oil for
lamps even out of the berries of the plane-tree by
steeping them in water and salt. There is also an
oil made from the wild vine—we have spoken about
the plant itself while dealing with perfumes. For
gleucinum must is boiled in oil with a slow heat, but
other makers do not use fite but leave the jar packed
round with grape-skins for three weeks‚ stirring up
the mixture twice a day, and the must becomes
absorbed by the oil. Some people mix in not only
marjoram but also more expensive scents, just as
the oil used in the gymnastic schools is also perfumed
with scents, though of a very poor quality. Oil is
also made from aspalathus, reed, balsam‚ iris,
cardamomum, melilot, Gallic nard, all-heal, mar-
joram, helenium, and cinnamomum root, by steep
ing all these plants in oil and then pressing out the
juices. Similarly also rose-oil is made from roses,
and rush—oil, which is very similar to oil of roseS‚ from
the sweet rush, and likewise oils are extracted from
henbane and from lupins and narcissus. A very large
amount is obtained in Egypt from radish seed or from

the blade of the grass called chortinon,a and likewise
from sesame and from the nettle called cnidinums'

In other places also an oil is made from filies, which
is left in the open air to steep in the sunlight and
moonlight and frost. On the border of Cappadocia
and Galatia they make from native herbs an oil called
Selgitic oil, of considerable value for the tendons;
and the same oil is made in Italy by the people of
Gubbio. From pitch is made an oil called pitch-om
while the pitch is kepton the boil‚ fleeces are stretched
above the steam rising from it and then wrung out.
