Three kinds are known in Asia: the black willow,
which is more useful for ties, the white willow for
agricultural purposes, and a third kind, which is the
shortest, called the helix. With us also many people
distinguish the same number of varieties by name;
they call one ‘plaiting willow ' and also ‘ purple willow,’
another, which is thinner, ‘dormouse willow ' from
its colour, and a third,the thinnest, ‘ Gallie willowss
