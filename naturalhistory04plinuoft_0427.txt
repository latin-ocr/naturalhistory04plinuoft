tree. XVII. The pinaster is nothing else but a wild
pine tree of smaller height throwing out branches
from the middle as the pine does at the top. This
variety gives a larger quantity of resin, in the manner
which we shall describe. It grows in flat countries
also. Most people think that trees called tibuli
that grow along the coasts of Italy are the same tree
with another name, but the tibulus is a slender tree
and more compact than the pinaster, and being free
from knots is used for building light gallies; it is
almost devoid of resin.

XVIII. T he pitch-pine loves mountains and cold
localities. It is a funereal tree, and is placed at the
doors of houses as a token of bereavement and grown
on graves3 nevertheless nowadays it has also been
admitted into our homes because of the ease with
which it can be clipped into various shapes. This
pine gives out a quantity of resin interspersed with
white drops so closely resembling frankincense that
when mixed with it they are indistinguishable to the
eye3 hence the adulteration is practised in the
Seplasia.⁰ All these classes of trees have short
leaves, but rather thick and hard like the leaf of the
cypress. The branches of the pitch-pine are of
moderate size and grow out almost immediately
from the root of the tree, attached to its sides like
arms.

Similarly the fir, which is in great demand for build-
ing ships, grows high up on mountains, as though
it had run away from the sea; and its shape is the
same as that of the pitch-pine. But it supplies
excellent timber for beams and a great many of the
appliances of life. Resin, which gives its value to the
pitch-pine, is a defect in the fir, which occasionally
