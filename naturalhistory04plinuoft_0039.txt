being the name of a tree that resembles the gum.

But these adulterations can be detected—and it

must be enough to state this once for all, to apply

to all other persumes as well—by smell, colour,
weight, taste and the action of fire. The Bactrian
bdellium is shiny and dry, and has a number

carried a long way inland, the treesb are of a re-
markable nature3 for they are to be seen on the
coast when the tide is out, embracing the barren
sands with their naked roots like polypuses, eaten
away by the salt and looking like trunks that have
been washed ashore and left high and dry, Also

although beaten by the waves3 indeed at high
water they are completely covered, and the evidence
of the facts clearly proves that this species of tree
is nourished by the brackish water. They are of
