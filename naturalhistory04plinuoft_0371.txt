that of the lentisk ; indeed the berries of the holly and
the may contain no juice3 and moreover the cherry
forms a class intermediate between the baca kind of
berries and the acinus kind ι its fruit is at first white,
as is that of almost all the bacae. At a later stage
with some the berry turns green, e.g. the olive and
the laurel; but in the case of the mulberry, the
cherry and the cornel it changes to red, and then
with the mulberry, cherry and olive it turns black.
XXX. Before the victory of Lucius Lucullus in the
war against Mithridates, that is down to 74 13.c.,
there were no cherry-trees in Italy. Lucullus first
imported them from Pontus, and in 120 years they
have crossed the ocean and got as far as Britain; but
all the same no attention has succeeded in getting
them to grow in Egypt. Of cherries the Apronian
are the reddest, and the Lutatian the blackest‚
while the Caecilian kind are perfectly round. The
J unian cherry has an agreeable flavour but practically

is so delicate that it does not stand carriage. The
highest rank, however, belongs to the bigaroonss
cherry called by the Campanians the Plinian cherry,
but in Belgium to the Lusitanian‚ and so also on the
banks of the Rhine. This cherry has a third kind of
colour, a blend of black, bright red and green, which
looks as if the fruit were always not quite ripe.· It is
less than five years ago that what is called the laurel-

bitter flavour, and is produced by grafting a cherry on
a bay-tree. There are also Macedonian cherries,
grown on a tree of small size and rarely exceeding
four and half feet in height, and ground-cherries, with
a still smaller bush. The cherry is one of the earliest
