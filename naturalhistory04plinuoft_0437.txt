BOOK XVI. xxm. 56-59

XXIII. W'e must not omit to state that with the
Greeks also the name of ‘live pitch' is given to
piteh which has been scraped off the bottom of sea-
going ships and mixed with wax—as life leaves
nothing untried——and which is much more efficacious
for all the purposes for which the pitehes and resins
are serviceable‚ this being because of the additional
hardness of the sea salt.

An opening is made in a piteh—tree on the side
towards the sun, not by means of an incision but by
a wound made by removing the bark, making an
aperture at most two feet long, so as to be at least
eighteen inches from the ground. Also the body
of the tree itself is not spared, as in other cases,
because the chips of wood are valuable; but the
ehips from nearest the surfaee are most esteemed,
those from deeper in giving the resin a bitter flavour.
Afterwards all the moisture from the whole tree
flows together into the wound3 and so also in the
case of the toreh-tree. When the liquid stops
flowing, an opening is made in a similar manner out
of another part of the tree and then another. After-
wards the whole tree is felled and the pith of the
timber is burnt. In the same way in Syria also they
strip the bark off the turpentine-tree, there indeed
stripping it from the branches and roots as well,
although the resin from these parts is not valued
highly. In Macedonia they burn the whole of the
male larch but only the roots of the female tree.
Tbeopompus wrote that in the territory of the
Apolloniates a mineral piteh is found that is not
inferior to that of Macedonia. The best piteh is
everywhere obtained from trees growing in sunny
places with a north-east aspect, whereas that from
