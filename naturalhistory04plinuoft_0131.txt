ate, only attached by a thread at its top end. The
flesh takes a year to ripen, though in some places,
for instance, Cyprus, it has a pleasant sweet flavour
even though it does not reach maturity. In Cyprus
the leaf is broader and the fruit rounder than it
is elsewhere, though people there do not eat the body
of the fruit, but spit it out after merely squeezing out
the juice. Also in Arabia the palm is said to have
a sickly swect taste, although J uba states that he
prefers the palm that grows in the territory of the
Tent-dweller Arabs, which they call the dablas‚ to
all other kinds for flavour. For the rest, it is stated
that in a palm—grove of natural growth the female
trees do not produce if there are no males, and that
each male tree is surrounded by several females with
more attractive foliage that bend and bow towards
him3 while the male bristling with leaves erected
impregnates the rest of them by his exhalation and
by the mere sight of him, and also by his pollen3
and that when the male tree is felled the females
afterwards in their widowhood become barren. And
so fully is their sexual union understood that mankind
has actually devised a method of impregnating them
by means of the flower and down collected from the
males, and indeed sometimes by merely sprinkling
their pollen on the females.

VIII. Palms are also propagated by layering‚ the
trunk for a length of three feet from the actual brain
of the tree being divided by incisions and dug into
the ground. Also a slip torn off from the root makes
a hardy growth when planted, and so does one from
the youngest of the branches. In Assyria the tree
itself, too, is laid in a moist soil and throws out roots
along its whole length, but these grow into shrubs
