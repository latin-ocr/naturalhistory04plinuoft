wood for their fleets; the largest cedar is reported
to have been grown in Cyprus and to have been
felled to make a mast for a galley with rowcrs in
teams of eleven belonging to Demetrius3 it was
one hundred and thirty feet long and took three
men to span its girth. The pirates of Germany
voyage in boats made of a single tree hollowed out,
some of which carry as many as thirty people.

The most close-grained of all timber and conse-
quently the heaviest is judgcd to be ebony and box,
both trees of a slender make. Neither will float in
water, nor will the cork-tree if its bark be removed,
nor the larch. Of the remainder the most close-
grained is the one called at Rome the lotus ‚a and next
the hard oak when the white sap-wood has been
removed. The hard oak also has wood of a dark
colour‚ and still darker is that of the cytisus, which
appears to come very near to ebony, although people
are to be found who assert that the turpentine-trees
of Syria are darker. Indeed there is a celebrated
artificer named Thericles who used to turn goblets
of turpentine-tree wood, which is a highly valucd
materian it is the only wood that needs to be oiled‚
and is improved by oil. Its colour can be wonderfully
counterfeited by staining walnut and wild pear wood
and boiling them in a chemical preparation. All
the trees that we have mentioned have hard close-
grained wood. Next after them comes the cornel,
though its wood cannot be given a shiny polish
because of its poor surface 3 but cornel wood is hardly
useful for anything else except the spokes of wheels
or in case something has to be wedged in wood or
fixed with bolts made of it, which are as hard as iron.
There are also the holm-oak, the wild and cultivated
