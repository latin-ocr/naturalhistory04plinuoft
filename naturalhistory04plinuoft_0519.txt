this fat is the iles-h of the tree and under the flesh
the bones, that is the best part of the timber. Those
trees which have a drier wood, for instance the olive,
are more liable to bear fruit only every other year
than trees whose wood is of a fleshy nature, like the
cherry. And not all trees have a large amount of
fat or flesh, any more than the most active among
animals; there is no fat or flesh at all in the box,
the cornel and the olive, nor any marrow, and only
a very small quantity even of blood, just as the service-
tree has no bones and the elder no flesh—though both
have a great deal of marrow—nor have reeds for the
greater part.

LXXIII. The flesh of some trees contains fibres
and veins. It is easy to distinguish between them,
the veins being broader and whiter than the fibre.
Veins are found in wood that is easy to split, and con-
sequently if you put your ear to one end of a beam
of wood however great its length you can hear even
'caps made with a graver on the other end, the sound
penetrating by passages running straight through
the wood, and by this test you can detect whether
the timber is twisted and interrupted by knots. In
the case of trees in which there are tuberosities
resembling the glands in the flesh of an animal, these
contain no vessels or fibres, but a kind of hard knot
of flesh rolled up in a ball; in the citrus and the
maple this is the most valuable part. The other
kinds of wood employed for making tables are cut
into circles by splitting the trees along the line of the
fibre, as otherwise the vein cut across the round
of the tree would be brittle. In beech trees the
