as in a rich soil it decays and in a thin soil it does not
come on at all3 its fastidiousness requires an inter-
mediate blend of soil, and that is why it is common in
the Sabine hill country. Its grapes are not attractive
to look at, but have an agreeable flavour; if they are
not gathered as soon as they are ripe, they will fall
off even before they decay. Its hardiness and the
size of the leaves protect the grapes against hail-
Storms.

The grapes called helvolae again are remarkable
for rather frequently varying in their colour‚ w hich⁰
is midway between the purple grapes and 1116 black
ones, and they hav e consequently been called by some
people varianae. Among them the blacker kind is
preferred3 both kinds bear large crops every other
year, though they make better wine when the crop
is less abundant. Also the praecia vine has two
varietieS, distinguished by the size of the grape3
these vines make a great deal of wood, and their
bunches are most useful for storing in jars3 the leaf
resembles parsley. The people of Durazzo speak
highly of the balisca vine, which the Spanish provinces
call coccolobis<13 its grapes grow in rather scanty
bunehes and can stand hot weather and south winds;
its wine is apt to go to the head, but the yield is
abundant. The Spanish provinces distinguish two
kinds of this vine, one having an oblong grape and
the other a round one3 they gather them last of
all. The sw eeter the coccolobis²3 grape is, the better
it is· ‚ but even if it has a rough taste it turns sweet
with age, and one that was sweet turns rough; in
the last state they‘are held to rival the wine of
Alba. It is said that to drink the juice of this
grape is very good for disorders of the bladder. The
