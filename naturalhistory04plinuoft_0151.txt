was particularly remarkable, not because of its fruit
or its utility for some purpose, but on account of the
circumstance that it has the appearance of a thorn,
but leaves resembling wings, which when somebody
touches the branches at once fall off and afterwards
sprout again.

discovery of paper to the victory of Alexander the
Great, when he founded Alexandria in Egypt, before
which time paper was not used. First of all people
