in J udaea and the Cyrenaic district of Africa; the
dates in Egypt, Cyprus, Syria and Seleucia in
Assyria do not keep, and consequently are used for
fattening swine and other stock. It is a sign that
the fruit is spoilt or old if the white excrescencc by
which the dates are attached to the cluster has
fallen off. Soldiers of Alexander were choked by
eating green dates3 this effect was produced in the
Gedrosi country by the quality of the fruit, and
occurs elsewhere from eating it to excess, for fresh
dates are so sweet that people will not stop eating
them except because of the danger.

X. Syria has several trees that are peculiar to it
beside this date3 in the class of nuts the pistachio is
well-known: it is reported that taken either in food
or in drink it is a remedy for snake-bite. In the fig
class Syria has the Carians and smaller figs of the same
class called cottana, also the plum α that grows on
Mount Damascus and the myxa, both now acclima·
tized in Italy. In Egypt the myxa is also used for
making wine.

XI. Phoenicia has a small variety of cedar that re-
sembles a juniper. It is of two kinds, the Lycian and
the Phoenician, which have different leaves; the
one with 3 hard, prickly, pointed leaf is called the
oxycedros, while the other is a branchy tree and the
wood is full of knots and has a better scent. They
bear fruit the size of a myrtle—berry, with a sweet
taste. The larger cedar also has two kinds, of which
the flowering one bears no fruit, while the one that
bears fruit does not flower, and in its case the previous
fruit is replaced by a new one. Its seed is like that
of the cypress. Some people call this tree the cedar-
pine. From it is obtained the resin held in the highest
