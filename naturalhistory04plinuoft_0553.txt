of Masurius is understood to be of the same age as
the city. Its roots spread right across the Municipal
Offiees as far as the Forum of Caesar. With this
there grew a cypress of equal age, which about the
closing period of Nero’s principate fell down and
was left lying.

LXXXVII. But on the Vatican Hill there is a holm-
oak that is older than the city ; it has a bronze tablct
on it with an inscription written in Etruscan charae-
ters, indicating that even in those days the tree was
deemed venerable. The people of T ivoli also date
their origin far before the city of Rome3 and
they have three holm-oaks still living that date
even earlier than their founder Tiburnus, the cere-
mony of whose installation is said to have taken
place near them3 but tradition relates that he
was the son of Amphiaraus, who died in battle
before Thebes a generation before the T rojan
war.

LXXXVIII. Authorities say that there is a plane-
tree at Delphi that was planted by the hand of Aga-
memnon, and also another at Caphya‚ a place in
Arcadia. There are trees at the present day growing
on the tomb of Protesilaus on the shore of the Dar-
danelles opposite the city of the Trojans, which in
every period since the time of Protesilaus, after
they have grown big enough to command a view
of Ilium, wither away and then revive again3 while
the oaks on the tomb of Ilus near the city are said to
have been planted at the date when the place first
began to be called Ilium.

LXXXIX. It is said that at Argos there still
survives the olive to which Argus tethered Io after
she had been transformed into a heifer. &Vest of
