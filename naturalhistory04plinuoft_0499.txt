it is the white ivy that kills trees, and by taking from

them all their sap grows so thick a stalk as itself to

become a tree. Its characteristics are very large,

very broad leaves, fat stiff buds, which in the other

kinds are bent, and clusters standing up erect3 and

although in every kind of ivy the arms take root,

arms, those of the black ivy coming next. But it is a

peculiarity of the white ivy that it throws out arms

as many points to strike root with as it has arms,

which make it safe and solid while it sucks and

strangles trees. There is also a difference in the

fruit of the white and the black ivy, since in some

cases it is so bitter that birds will not touch it.

no corners, and throws out tendrils from its stalk;

the flower is white and has the scent of a lily. It bears

clusters of berries like those of the wild vine, not ofthe

ivy3 they are red in colour, and the larger ones en-
