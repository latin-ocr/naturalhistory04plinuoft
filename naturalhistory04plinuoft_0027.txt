BOOK XII. vm. 17—x. 21

Kings of Persia every three years a hundred logs

of ebony, together with gold and ivory. Nor

also should we omit the fact, since that author
indicates it, that the Ethiopians used to pay twenty

large elephant tusks on the same account. So high

was the esteem in which ivory was held in the 3lOth
yeara of our city, the date at which that author
composed his history at Thurii in Italy ; which makes

all the more surprising the statement which we accept muntiis.
on his authority, that nobody of Asia or Greece had
hitherto been seen who had ever seen the river Po.

The exploration of the geography of Ethiopia, which

as we have said had lately been reported to the VLISI.
Emperor Nero, showed that over a space of 1,996

miles from Syene on the frontier of the empire to
Meroe trees are rare, and there are none except of

the palm species. That is possibly the reason why
ebony was the third most important item in the
tribute paid.

IX. Ebony was exhibited at Rome by Pompey the Van-effes of
Great on the occasion of his triumph over Mithridates, ebony.
According to Fabius ebony does not give out a flame,
yet burris with an agreeable scent. It is of two
kinds: the better one, which grows as a tree, is
rare—it is of a smooth substance and free from
knots, and of a shiny black colour that is pleasing
to the eye even in the natural state without the
aid of art3 whereas the other grows as a shrub
like the cytisus, and is spread over the whole of
India.

X. In India there is also a thorn the wood of The snagan
which resembles ebony, but can be detected even ‘smn-
by the flame of a lantern, as the light at once shines

through.⁶
