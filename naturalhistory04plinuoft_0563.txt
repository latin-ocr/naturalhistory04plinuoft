and not one half of its full size. Hailing the moon in
a native word that means ‘healing all things‚’ they
prepare a ritual sacrifice and banquet beneath a trec
and bring up two white bulls‚ whose horns are bound
for the first time on this occasion. A priest arrayed
in white vestments climbs the tree and with a
golden sickle cuts down the mistletoe‚ which is
caught in a white cloak. 'l‘hen finally they kill the
victims, praying to God to render his gift propitious
to those on whom he has bestowed it. They believe
that mistletoe given in drink will impart fertility to
any animal that is barren, and that it is an antidote
for all poisonS. So powerful is the superstition in
regard to trifling matters that frequently prevails
among the races of mankind.
