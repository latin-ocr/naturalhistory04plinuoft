BOOK XV. VI. 20—22

while he recommends planting the Licinian olive in
a cold and thin soil, for the reason that rich or warm
earth ruins its oil and the tree gets exhausted by
its mere fertility, and moreover is attacked by moss
and red rust. He advises that olive-yards should be
in a position exposed to the sun and facing west, and
he does not approve of any other arrangement. He
says that the best way of preserving orchites and
posia olives is either to put them in brine when they
are green or to crush them and store them in mastic
oil; the best olive-oil is made from the bitterest
olive obtainable3 for the rest the olives should be
collected off the ground as soon as possible, and
washed if they are dirty3 it is enough to leave
thern to dry for three days, and if the weather is
cold and frosty they must be pressed on the fourth
day, and when pressed they should be sprinkled
with salt. Olives kept on a boarded floor lose oil
and it deteriorates in quality, and the same
happens if the oil is left on the lees and the
grounds—these are the flesh of the olive and
produce the dregs; consequently it should be ladled
several times a day, and moreover this must be done
with a shell and into leaden caldrons, as copper
spoils it. All these operations, he says, must be
carried on with presses that have been heated and
tightly closed, admitting as little air as possible, and
therefore also no wood should be cut there (and con-

stones of the olives themselves); the oil must be
poured out of the caldrons into vats‚ so as to leave
behind the grounds and the lees ε for this purpose the
vessels must be changed fairly frequently and the
osier baskets wiped with a sponge, so that so far as
