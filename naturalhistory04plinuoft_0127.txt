sweet but will not keep for any time. On the other

with wine, and some of them with bread, while a very
large number rely on it also for cattle fodder. For
this reason, therefore, we shall be justified in describ-

in Italy not grown under cultivation, nor are there in
any other part of the earth except where there is a
warm climate, while only in really hot countries does
the palm bear fruit. VII. It grows in a light sandy
soil and for the most part in one containing nitrateS.

they do not mix the dung with water from a
