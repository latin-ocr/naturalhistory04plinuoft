being hung on such a lofty gibbet ! There is an Italian
trec ‘² on the other side of the Po called the rumpot-
inus, or by another name the opulus, the broad circular
stories of which are covered by vines which spread out
with their bare snaky growth to where the tree forks
and then throw out their tendrils along the upraised
fingers of the branches. Also vines when propped up
with stakes about as tall as a man of middle height
make a shaggy growth and form a whole vineyard
from a cutting, by the unconscionable creeping of
their rods and the rambling of their tendrils over
all the empty gaps, completely filling the middle of a
courtyard. So many are the different varieties that
even Italy alone harbours.

In some of the provinces the vine stands by itself Varieeies os
without any prop, gathering its limbs together inward {gssssegssd
and providing nutriment for thick growth by means
of their shortness. In other places this is prohibited
by the wind, for instance, in Africa and in parts of
the province of N arbonne, where vines are prevented
from growing beyond their pruned stumps and
always resemble plants that are hoed, straying across
the fields like herbaceous plants and drinking up the
juice of the soil with their grapes as they go3 and
consequently in the interior of Africa the clusters ex-
ceed the body of an infant child in size. In no other
country are the vines harsher, but nowhere else have
the grapes a more agreeable firmness, which is very
possibly the source of the name ‘ hard grape.’ As to
varieties in respect of size, colour and flavours of the
berry they are innumerable and they are actually
multiplied by the varieties of wine: in one district
they have a brilliant purple colour, in another a rosy
glow or a glossy green tint3 for grapes that are
