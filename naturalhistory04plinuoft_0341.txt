that the fruit should have a bed of close-packed straw
or of chaff underneath, and should be placed far
apart so that the spaces between the rows may admit

stored in a place kept shut up, from which all draughts
are excluded, or else that they should be boiled or
soaked in honey. Pomegranates should be hardened
in boiling sea-water and then dried in the sun for
three days and hung up in such a way as to be pro-
tected from the dew at night, and when wanted for
use they should be thoroughly washed in fresh water.

jars of sand, and also while they are unripe covering
them with earth in pots with the bottom broken out
but with all air shut out from them and with their
stalk smeared with pitch‚ as so kept they grow to an
