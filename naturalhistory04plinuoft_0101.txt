LVI. Syria also supplies galbanum,‘² which also olzherscent-
grows on Mount Amanus3 it comes from a kindpam‘
of fennel which they call stagonitis‚ like the resin
of the same name. The kind of galbanum most
esteemed is cartilaginous, clear like hammonia-
cum and free from all woody substance. Even so
it is adulterated with beans or with sacopenium.⁶
Pure galbanum, if burnt, drives away snakes with
