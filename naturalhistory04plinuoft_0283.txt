about vintage time it should be boiled before being
used.

The pitch most highly esteemed in Italy for vessels
intended for storing wine is that which comes from
the Bruttii3 it is made from the resin of the pitch-
pine. But the pitch obtained from the wild pine in
Spain is very little valued, as resin from that tree is
bitter and dry and has a disagreeable smell. The
varieties of pitch and the method of making it we
shall set out in the next volume when we are dealing
with forest trees. The defects in resin beside those
already mentioned are acridity or else a smoky tang,
while the fault of pitch is being over-burnt3 but the
test is if when it is broken up the pieces have a lumi-
nous appearance, and if they stick to the teeth with
an agreeably tart taste. In Asia pitch from Ida is
most popular, and in Greece that of Pieria, but
virgil gives the preference to the pitch of Naryse.
The more careful makers mix with the wine black
mastich, which is found in Pontus and which resembles
bitumen, and also iris-root and oil. As for waxing
the vessels it is found that this makes the wine turn
sour3 but it pays better to transfer the wine into
vessels that have contained vinegar than into those
which have contained sweet wine or mead‚ Cato
recommends that wine should be ⁴ adjusted '—-this is
the word he uses a—by adding lye-ashes boiled with
boiled-down must in the proportion of a fortieth part
to the wine skin‚ or else a pound and a half of salt,
also occasionally some pounded marble; he also
mentions sulphur, but he only puts resin near the
end of the list. then the wine is beginning to
mature he advises adding on the top of all some of
