which ensures that there are cones riptning in every
single month of the year. Pine cones that split
while still on the tree are called azaniae, and if they
are not removed they injure the rest of 'thc crop.

XLV. The only trees that bear no fruit—I mean not α

even seed—are the tamarisk, which is of no usc except
for making brooms‚‘² the poplar, the aldcr‚ the Atinian
elm and the alaternus, the leaves of which are between
those of the holm-oak and the olivc; but trees that
never grow from seed nor bear fruit are considered
to be unlucky and under a curse. Cremutius states

never green. People open gum-producing trees
after they have budded‚ but the gum does not
thicken until after the fruit has been removed.

the apple and the pear, and also the pomegranate‚
which excessive dew and frost cause to lose its
flower as well. In consequence of this people bend
down its branches, lest if they shoot straight upright
they may receive and retain the moisture which is
injurious to them. The pear and almond lose their
blossom even if it does not rain but a south wind
sets in or the sky is cloudy, and if that sort of weather
has prevailed after they have shed their blossom,
they lose their first fruit. But it is the willow that
loses its seed most quickly, before it approaches
ripeness at all. This is the reason why Homer gives
it the epithet ‘ fruit-losing '3 ⁶ but succeeding ages
have interpreted the meaning of the word in the
light of its own wicked conduct, inasmuch as it is
well known that willow seed taken as a drug produces
