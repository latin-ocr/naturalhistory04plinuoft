and the legs of our tables made of the same ivory.
It is stated that the Gauls, iinp=·isoned as they were
by the Alps as by a then insuperablc bulwark‚ first
found a motive for overflowing into Italy from the
circumstance that a Gallie citizen from Switzerland
named Helico, who had sojourned at Rome on account
of his skill as an artificer, had brought with him when
he came back some dried figs and grapes and some
samples of oil and wine; and consequently we may
pardon them for having sought to obtain these things
even by means of war.

III. But who would not be justifiably surprised to
hear that a tree has been procured from another clime
merely for the sake of shade? This tree is the plane,
which was first imported into the Ionian Sea as far as
the island of San Domenico to plant over the tomb
of Diomede, and which crossed from there to Sicily
and was one of the first trees bestowed on Italy, and
which has now travelled as far as Belgium and actually
occupies soil that pays tribute α to Rome, so that the
tribes have to pay rent even for shade. The elder
Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, imported plane-trees
to the city of Reggio as a marvel to adorn his palace,
on the site where afterwards a gymnasium was built;
and it is found in the authorities that these trees were
not able to grow to full size, and that in all Italy
there were no others except the ‘ Spania.' '⁷ IV.
This took place at about the period of the capture
of Rome3C and so much honour has since accrued
to plane-trees that their growth is encouraged by
having wine poured on them, as it has been
found that this is of the greatest benefit to the

ἱοὲζε, apd we have taught even trees to be wine-
