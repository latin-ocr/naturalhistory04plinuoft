the hardiest trees to live are olives, seeing that it is

ΧὲἷΙ. On a hill named Corne in the territory of T us· Celebratcd
culum, near the city, there is a grove named Corne {2225ssss
which has been held in reverence from early times
by the district of Latium as sacred to Diana ; it consists
of a beech coppice the foliage of which has the appear-
ance of having been trimmcd by art. This grove con-
tains one outstanding tree which in our generation
excited the affection of the orator Passienus Crispus,
who had twice been consul and who subsequently
became still more distinguished by marrying Agrip—
pina and becoming the stepfather of Nero3 Crispus
used regularly not merely to lie beneath the tree and
to pour wine over it, but to kiss and embrace it. Close
to this grove is a holm-oak which is also famous, as
measuring thirty-four feet round the trunk, and
sending out what look like ten separate trees of
remarkable size and forming a wood of itself.

XCII. It is a well-known fact that trees are killed Parasitic
by ivy. Some people believe that a similar property ξξζέἑὶδ ro
noxious to trees, though operating more slowly, is also crees.
contained in mistletoe—for this plant also is recognised
as by no means among the least remarkable on
account of other properties beside its berries.

For some varieties of plants cannot grow in the
earth, and take root in trees, because they have no
abode of their own and consequently live in that of
others : instances of this are mistletoe and the plant in
Syria called cadytas, which twines itself round not
only trees but even teasels‚ and likewise in the dis-
trict about Tempe in Thessaly the plant called
polypodium, and also the dolichos and the serpyllum.
