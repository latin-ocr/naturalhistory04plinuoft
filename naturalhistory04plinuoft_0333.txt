BOOK XV. xlv. 47-xv. 50

‘ Medic apples‚' after their native country. Equally
foreign are the juj ube-tree and the tuber-apple,
which themselves also have only recently come into
Italy, the former from Africa and the latter from
Syria. Sextus Papinius, who was consul in our Aa). 23.
own day, introduced each of them in the last years of
the principate of his late Majesty Augustus, having ,
grown thern in his camp from slips ; the fruit is more
like a berry than an apple‚ but the trees make a par-
ticularly good decoration for terraces——as nowadays
we have whole forests of vegetation growing even
over the roofs of our houses. There are two kinds of
tuber-apple, the white and the red Syriam so called
from its colour. The fruit called wool-fruit, growing
in the district of Verona but nowhere else in Italy, is
virtually an exotic3 it is covered with a woolly down,
which grows also in very large quantities on the
sparrow-quince and the peach, but which has given
its name to this fruit in particular as it has no other
remarkable property to recommend it.

XV. Why should I hesitate to indicate by name Fruittrees

recently intro·

the remaining varieties of fruit, seeing that they have duced from
prolonged the memory of those who established them almad-
for all time, as though on account of some outstanding
achievement in life? Unless Ι am mistaken, the
recital will reveal the ingenuity exercised in grafting,

and will show that nothing is so trifling as to be
incapable of producing celebrity. Well then, there

are kinds of fruit that have their origin from Matius

and Cestius, from Mallius, and likewise from Scau-
dius3 and on the last a member of the Claudian
family named Appius grafted the quince, producing

the fruit called Appian3 this has the smell ofa quince,

the size of a Scaudian apple, and a ruddy colour.
