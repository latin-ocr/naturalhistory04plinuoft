BOOK XII. x. 21—xn. 24

We will now describe the trees that aroused the
wonder os the victorious expedition of Alexander
the Great when that part of the world was first
revealed.

XI. The Indian fig-tree‘¹ bears exceptionally fine The Indian
fruit, and it is sels-propagating, as it spreads its α’ ’·
branches to an enormous width and the bottom ones
bend down to the earth so heavily that in a year's
time they take root, and produce for themselves 3
fresh offspring planted in a circle round the parent
tree like the work of an ornamenta] gardener. In-
side this bower the shepherds dwell in summer, as it
is at once shaded and protected by the fence of the
tree——a very attractive sight when looked at from
below or from a distance, with its vaulted dome. Its
higher branches, however, shoot upward to 3 great
height from the main bulk of the mother tree,
forming an extensive grove, so as in many cases to
enclose a circle sixty yards across, while they cover
with their shade a space of a quarter of a mile. The
broad leaves have the shape of an Amazon's shield;
consequently they cover over the fruit and prevent
it from growing, and it is scanty and not larger in
size than 3 bean3 but as it is ripened by the rays of
the sun shining through the foliage it has an extremely
sweet taste, and is worthy of the marvellous tree that
produces it. This fig grows mostly in the neighbour-
hood of the river Chenaub.

XII. There is another fig the fruit of which is larger The bamma.
and superior in flavour; the sages of India live on it.

The leaf of this tree resembles birds’ wings, and
is a yard and a half long and 3 yard broad. The
fruit grows out of the bark, and is remarkable for the
sweetness of its juice3 one bunch is enough for four
