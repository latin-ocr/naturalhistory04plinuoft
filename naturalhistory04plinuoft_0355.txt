in front of the temple of Saturn, which in 404 Bc,
after a sacrifice had been offered by the Vestal
Virgins‚ was removed, because it was upsetting a
statue of Silvanus. A tree of the same kind that was
sels-sown lives in the middle of the forum, at the
spot where, when the foundations of the Empire were
collapsing in portent of disaster, Curtius had filled up
the gulf‘ with the greatest of treasures‚ I mean virtue
and piety and a glorious death. Likewise self-sown

planted by the care of the populace for the sake of
the shade3 an altar in the forum was removed on
the occasion of the gladiatorial show given by his late
Majesty Julius, the most recent one that fought in
the forum.

XXI. A remarkable fact about the fig is that this
alone among all the fruits hastens to ripen with a
rapidity due to the skill of nature. There is a wild
variety of fig called the goat-fig which never ripens,
but bestows on another tree what it has not got itself,
since it is a natural sequence of causation, just as
from things that decay something is generated.
Consequently this fig engenders gnats b which,
being cheated out of nutriment in their mother tree,
fly away from its decaying rottenness to the
kindred tree,⁰ and by repeatedly nibbling at the figs
—that is by feeding on them too greedily d—they
open their orifices and so make a way into them,
bringing with them the sun into the fruit for the first
time and introducing the fertilizing air through the
passages thus opened. Then they consume the
milky juice—-this is the symptom of the fruit’s
infancy e—whieh also dries up of its own accord ; and
