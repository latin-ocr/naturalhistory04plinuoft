wine may be given the scent of pitch and some
touches of its piquant flavour. It is thought that a
more effective way of doing this is by means of raw
flower of resin, this giving briskness to the smooth
quality of the wine, while on the other hand resin-
juice α is believed to mitigate the excessive harshness
of a wine and to conquer its asperity, or in the case
of a thin, smooth, flat wine to add a touch of asperity
—this is especially done with the musts of Liguria and
the localities on the border of the river Po. The
beneficial employment of resin-juice is adjusted in
this way : a larger quantity of J uice is put into strong,
fiery wines, and it is used more sparingly with thin,
flat ones. Some people advise using both resin-
juice and pitch to season must ; and in fact must has
a certain pitchy quality and in some districts the
fault of must is that it ferments a second time of its
own accord, a disaster that destroys its flavour3 this
liquor is given the name of vappa, which is also applied
as a terni of opprobrium to human beings when their
spirit has deteriorated. For the tartness of vinegar
possesses a valuable quality useful for important
purposes, and without which it is impossible to live in
comparative comfort. For the rest, so much atten-
tion is given to the treatment of wines that in some
places ashes are employed, as is gypsum elsewhere,
and the methods that we have specified, for the pur- §120-
pose of improving their condition3 but preference is
given to ashes obtained from vine-clippings or from
oakwood. Also it is recommended that sea-water
should be used for this purpose that has been obtained
a long way out at sea at the spring equinox and then
kept in store, or at all events that it should be taken
up during the night at the time of the solstice and
