how to make wine from the black myrtle, by drying
it in the shade until no moisture remained and then
putting it in must3 he says that if the berrics are not
thoroughly dried, oil is produced. Afterwards a way
was also discovered of making a white wine from the
pale variety, by steeping a quart ofpounded myrtle in
a pint and a half of wine and then pressing out the
liquor. The leaves are also dried by themselves
till they go to a powder, which is used as a cure for
sores on the human body, the powder being slightly
corrosive and serving to cool off the perspiration.
Moreover, the oil also curiously enough contains a
certain flavour of wine, and at the same time has a
greasy fluidity which makes it specially efficacious
for improving wines if it is poured over the wine-
strainers before they are used3 this is because the
oil retains the lees and only allows the pure liquor to
pass through, and unites with the wine after it has
been strained‚ greatly improving it. Sprigs of myrtle
also merely by being carried by a traveller are bene-

been touched by iron are a cure for swellings in the

wearing a wreath made of the myrtle of Venus
Victrix, and so made that tree a coveted object even
for our enemies. Subsequently a myrtle wreath was
regularly worn by generals celebrating an ovation,
