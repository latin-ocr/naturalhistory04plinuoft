It is the only fruit which nature has enclosed in 3
covering made ofpieces fitted together ; for the shell
is divided into two boat-shapcd picces‚ and the kernel
is further separated into four sections with a woody
membrane running between them. In all the other
kinds of nut the whole is in one solid picce‚ as for
instance in the hazel, itsclf also a sort of nut, the
previous form of its name having been Abellina,
after the name ofits place oforigin 3 ⁰ but it carne into
Asia and Greece from Pontus and is consequently
also called the Pontic nut. This nut also is pro-

third variety of the nut class is the almond, which
has an outer integument like that of the walnut but
thinner, and also a second covering consisting of a
shell; but the kernel is unlike a walnut's in its
breadth⁶ and its hard part is more bitter. It is
doubtful whether this tree existed in Italy in the
time of Cato, as he calls (ἶ almonds ‘ Greek nuts‚' 3

walnuts. Beside these Cato adds a smooth‚ hard
kind ofhazel-nut, the Palestrina nut, which he praises
very highly and says can be kept fresh and green by
being potted and buried in the ground. At the
present day the almonds of Thasos and Alba are
famous, and two kinds grown at Taranto, one with a
brittle shell and the other with 3 hard shell, which are
very large in size and very little rounded in shape;
also famous is the ‘ soft nut‚’ which breaks through
its shell. Some interpret the word for walnut as
honorific and say it means ‘ Jove’s acorn.' θ Ι
