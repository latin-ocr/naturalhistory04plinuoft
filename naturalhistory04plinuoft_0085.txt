as an ingredient in unguents. It fetches up to 6

XLVI. The Cave-dweller country and the Thebaid
and Arabia where it separates Judaea from Egypt
all alike have the myrobalanum,‘¹ which is grown for
scent, as is shown by its name itself, which also indi-
cates in addition that it is 3 11111; 11 13 3 tree with 3
leaf that resembles that of the heliotrope, which we
shall describe among the herbaceous plants, and 3
fruit the size of 3 113Ζ61- 11111. The variety growing in
Arabia 13 called the S) rian nut, andis white 111 colour,
11 hereas the Thebaid kind is black3 the foimer is
preferred for the excellent quality of 1116 011 extracted
from it, but the Thebaic for its large yield. The
Cave-dweller kind is the worst among the varieties.
Some persons prefer to 111636 1116 Ethiopian behen,
which 1133 3 black oily nut and a slender kernel, but
the liquid squeezed out of it has a stronger scent3
it grows in level districts. It is said that the Egyptian
nut is even more oleaginous and has 3 thicker shell
of a reddish colour, and that though it grows on
mai-shy ground the plant is shorter and drier, whereas
the Arabian variety, on the contrary, is green in colour
and also smaller in size and more compact in shape b
because it likes mountain regions3 but the Petraean
kind, coming from the town mentioned above, is a
long way the best—it has a black rind and a white
kernel. Perfumiers, however, only extract the juice
from the shells‚ but medical men also crush the
kernels‚ gradually pouring warm water on them while
pounding them.
