BOOK XIV. 111. 18—-1v, 22

the vine α has been introduced into the camp, and in

the hand of the centurions is the mainstay of supreme ’

authority and command and with its rich reward it
lures on the laggard ranks to the tardy eagles,¹’ and
even in offences it confers honour on punishment
itself.⁶ Moreover it was vineyardsd that suggested
a method for siege-trains. As for medicines‚ grapes
hold such an important place among them that they
act as remedies in themselves, merely by supplying
wme.

IV. Democritus, who professed to know all the
different kinds of vines in Greece, was alone in think-
ing it possible for them to be counted, but all other
writers have stated that there is a countless and
infinite number of varieties ; and the truth of this will
appear more clearly if we consider the various kinds
of wines. We shall not mention all of. them, but
the most famouS‚ inasmuch as there are almost as
many wines as there are districts, so that it will be
enough to have pointed out the most celebrated kinds
of wine or the ones remarkable for some special
property.

The highest rank is given to the vines of Aminaea‚
on account of the body of that wine and its life, which
undoubtedly improves with age. There are five
varietiese of these vines3 of these the ‘younger
sister ’ with a smaller berry sheds its blossom betters
and can stand rain and stormy weather‚ which is not
the case with the ‘ elder sister‚' though this is less
liable to damage when trained on a tree than when
on a frame. The ‘ twin sisterS‚' which have got this
name because the bunches always grow in pairs,
give a wine with a very rough flavour but of ex-

I .e. with less damage to the young grape, cs. ξ 34.
