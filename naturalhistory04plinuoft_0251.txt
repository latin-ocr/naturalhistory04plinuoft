X. Up to this point the goodness of a wine is 4medicssinal
credited to the countries of its growth. Among the ὑπή '⁰⁸⁷²'
Greeks, the wine they have called ‘life ’ has justly
won a very distinguished name, having been de-
veloped for the treatment of a great many maladies‚

the grapes are picked a little before they are ripe
and are dried in a fierce sun, being turned three
times a day for three days, and on the fourth day
they are put through the press and then left in
casks to mature in the sun. The people of Cos
mix in a rather large quantity of sea-water—a
custom arising from the peculation of a slave who
used this method to fill up the due measure, and
this mixture is poured into white must, producing
what is called in Greek ‘ white Coan.’ In other
countries a blend made in a similar way is called
⁴ sea-flavoured wine‚' and ‘ sea-treated ' when the
vessels containing the must have been thrown into
the sea3 this is a kind of wine that matures young.

making Coan wine out of Italian, his most important
instruction being that it must be left in the sun for

four years ⁰ to ripen. The Rhodes vintage resembles

that of Cos, but the Phorinean is salter. All the
overseas wines are thought to take seven years to

reach the middle stage of maturity.
