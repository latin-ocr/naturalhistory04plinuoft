BOOK XIII. xxx. 96—99

XXX. The outstanding merit of citrus-wood tables is
to have wavy marks forming a vein or else little spirals.
The former marking produces a longish pattern and
is consequently called tiger-wood, while the latter
gives a twisted pattern and consequently slabs of
that sort are called panther—tables. Also some have
wavy crinkled markings, which are more esteemed if
they resemble the ey es in a peacock' s tail. Besides
the kinds previously mentioned, great esteem,
though coming after these, belongs to those veined
with a thieko cluster of what look like grains,
these slabs being consequently called parsley-wood,
from the resemblance. But the highest value of all
resides in the colour of the wood, the colour of meed
being the most favoured, shining with the wine that
is proper to it.“ The next point is size: now-a-
days tables made of whole trunks are admired, or
several trunks morticed together in one table.

The faults in a table are woodiness—that is the
name given to a dull patternless uniformity in the
timber, or uniformity arranged like the leaves of 3
plane-tree‚ and also to a grain resembling the veining
or colouring of the holm-oak—and to flaws or hairy
lines resembling flaws, a fault to which heat and wind
have rendered the timber particularly liable3 next
comes a colour running across the wood in 3 black
streak like a lamprey and marked with irregular
raven-scratchings as on a poppy and in general rather
approaching black‚ or blotches of various colours.
The natives bury the timber in the ground while still
green, giving it 3 0031 of wax3 but carpenters lay
it in heaps of corn for periods of 3 week with
intervals of a week between, and it is surprising
how much its weight is reduced by this process.
