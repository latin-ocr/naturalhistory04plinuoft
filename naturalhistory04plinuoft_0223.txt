they have special names, a vine at Florence being
called sopina and some at Arezzo ⁴ mole-vinc ' and
‘ seasonal vine ’ and ‘ crossed vine.’ ⁰ The mole—vine
has black grapes and makes a white must ; the seasonal
vine is a deceptive plant, giving a more admirable
wine the larger crop of grapes it bears, and, remark-
able to say, coming to the end of its fertility and its
good quality at the same time3 the crossed vine has
black grapes and makes a wine that does not keep at all
long, but its grape keeps a very long time, and it is
gathered a fortnight later than any other variety,
bearing a large crop ofgrapes but only good for eating.
The leaves of this vine, like those of the wild vine,
turn a blood-red colour before they fall off ; this also
happens with some other vines, and is a sign of ex-
tremely inferior quality. The itriola is peculial· to Um-
bria and to the districts of Bevagna and Ancona, and
the ‘ dwarf-vine ’ to that of San Vettorino. The same
districts have the bananica, an unreliable vine, though
people become fond of it. The people of Pompei
give the name of their township to a grape, although
it grows in greater quantity at Chiusi3 the people of
Tivoli also name a grape after their townsffip, al-
though they have lately discovered the ‘ olive-grape,'
so called from its resemblance to an olive ε this is the
latest grape introduced hitherto. The vinaciola grape
is only known to the Sabines and the calventina to the
people of Mount Gaurus. Vines transplanted from
the Falernian territory are, I am aware, called
‘ Falernian,' but they very quickly degenerate every-
where. Some people also have made out a Sorrento
variety, with a very sweet grape. The ‘ smoke-grape,’
the ‘ mouthful ’ and the tharrupia, which grow on the
hills of Thurii, are not picked before there has been a
