BOOK XVI. Lxxv1. 197-199

In trees of this class there is also a difference
corresponding to their native countries. The most
highly spoken of grow on the Alps and the Apennincs,
on the .J ura and Vosges mountains of Gaul, in Corsica,
Bithynia, Pontus and Macedonia. The firs of Aenia
and Arcadia are inferior, and those of Parnassus
and Euboea the worst, because in those places they
are branchy and twisted and the wood is apt to rot.
As for the cedar, those in Crete, Africa and Syria
are the most highly spoken of. Timber well smeared
with ccdar oil does not suffer from maggot or decay.
The juniper has the same excellence as the cedar3
this trec grows to a great size in Spain and especially
in the territory of the Vaccaei3 the heart of its
timber is everywhere ‘² even more solid than that
of the cedar. A general fault of all timber is what
is called cross-grain, when the veins and knots have
grown twisted. In some trees are found centres
like those in marble, that is hard pieces like a nail,
unkind to the saw3 and there are some hardnesses
due to accident, as when a stone, or the branch of
another tree, has been caught in a hollow and
taken into the body of the tree. It is said that
stones found inside trees serve as a preventive
against abortion. In the market-place at Me·
gara long stood a wild olive tree on which brave
warriors had hung their weapons3 these in the
course of time had been hidden by the bark grow-
ing round thern3 and on this tree depended the
fate of the city, an oracle having prophesied that
it would be destroyed when a tree gave birth to
arms—which happened to this tree when it was
cut down, greaves and helmets being found in-
side it.
