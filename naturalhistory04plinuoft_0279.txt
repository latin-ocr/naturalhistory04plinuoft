and pour this into their wines to overcome their
harshness. Still both in the case of this kind of wine
and in all others they supply thc vessels themselves
with coatings of pitch, the method of making which
will be described in the next volume. ΧΠ. 52.

resin, and the province of Asia,‘¹ which lies between
the two, has some ofboth sorts. In the East the best
and finest resin is produced by the turpentine-tree‚
and next by the lentisk—the latter being also called
gum-mastic3 afterwards comes the juice of the
cypress, which has a very sharp flavour—all of these
trees producing a liqujd juice and merely a resin,
whereas the juice of the cedar is thicker and suitable
for making pitch. Arabian resin is white and has a
sharp scent, stifling to a person engaged in boiling it 3
the resin of Judaea dries harder and has a stronger
scent than even that from the turpentine-tree; and
Syrian resin has a resemblance to Attic honey. The
resin of Cyprus excels all other kinds; it likewise is
the colour of honey, and has a fleshy consistency.
That of Colophon is yellower than the rest, but if
ground up turns white3 it has a rather oppressive
scent, and consequently the persumers do not make
use of it. In Asia a very white resin is made from
the pitch-pinc3 it is called psagdas. All resin can
be dissolved in oil, and some people think that
potter's chalk can also be so dissolved3 and I am
ashamed to confess that the chief value now set on
resin is for use as a depilatory for men.

The method of seasoning wine is to sprinkle the ese osresin
