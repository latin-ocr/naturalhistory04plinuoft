the royal laurel, which has begun to be called the
Augusta laurel, a very large tree with a very large
leaf and berries without any rough taste. Some say
that the royal laurel and the Augusta are not the
same, and make out the royal to be a special kind,
with longer and broader leaves. The same persons
place in another class, under the name of bacalia, the
laurel which is the commonest of all and bears the
largest number of berries, but much to my surprise
give the name of triumphal laurel to one that has no
berries, and say that this is the one used by persons

sprung from the laurel which was sent down to him
from heaven, which was a very low growing tree with
a short, crinkled leaf, and very rarely met with. In
ornamenta] gardem'ng there is also the Thasos laurel,
which has a tiny leafy fringe as it were growing out
of the middle of the leaf, and the gelded laurel, with-

lack of sun and which consequently fills the ground
with its shoots in however shady a place. There is
also the ground laurel, a shrub that grows wild, and
Alexandrine laurel, which some call Idaean‚ others
hypoglottion,a others Danae, others carpophyllon,⁶
others hypelates.c This laurel spreads out branches 9
inches long from its root, and is useful for making
wreaths3 the leaf is more pointed than that of the
myrtle, and softer, brighter in colour and larger3 the
seed, which lies between the leaves, is red, it grows
in great abundance on Mount Ida and in the vicinity
of Heraclea in Pontus, and it only occurs in mountain
districts. Also the class of laurel called daphnoides
is involved in a competition of nomenclature, as some
