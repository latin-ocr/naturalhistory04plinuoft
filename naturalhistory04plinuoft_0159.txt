emperor Claudius. The reason was that the thin
paper of the period of Augustus was not strong
enough to stand the friction of the pen, and moreover
as it let the writing show through there was a fear
of a smudge being caused by what was written on
the back, and the great transparency of the paper
had an unattractive look in other respects. Conse-
quently the foundation was made of leaves of second
quality and the woof or cross layer of leaves of the
first quality. Claudius also increased the width of
the sheet‚ making it a foot across. There were also
eighteen-inch sheets called ‘ macrocola,' ‘² but
examination detected a defect in them, as tearing
off a single strip damaged several pages. On this
account Claudius paper has come to be preferred to
all other kinds, although the Augustus kind still
holds the field for correspondence; but Livia paper,
having no quality of a first-class kind, but being
entirely second class, has retained its position.

ivory or a shell‚ but this makes the lettering apt to fade, pr⁰⁶e⁸³'
as owing to the polish so given the paper does not
take the ink so well, but has a shinier surface. The
damping process if carelessly applied often causes
difficulty in writing at first, and it can be detected
by a blow with the mallet, or even by the musty smell
if the process has been rather carelessly carried out.
Spottiness also may be detected by the eye, but a bad
porous strip found inserted in the middle of the pasted
joins, owing to the sponginess of the papyrus, suc-ks up
the ink and so can scarcely be detected except when
the ink of a letter runs: so much opportunity is there
for cheating. The consequence is that another task is
added to the process of paper-weaving.
