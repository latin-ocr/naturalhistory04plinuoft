Ior use as venem a thready veining is approved ’
of (it is called fennel— -pattern gr· {in on account of
the resemblance), because in every kind of wood
pieces with gaps and twists in them do not take the
glue; some woods cannot be joined by glueing
either with wood of the same kind or with other woods,
for example hard oak, and in general materials
unlike in substance do not hold together, for instance
isone tried to join stone and wood. The wood of the
service-trec, the hornbeam and the box have a very
strong dislike for cornel wood, and so to a smaller
degree has lime. All of the woods we have de-
scribed as yielding are easily bent for all purposes,
and so besides are mulberry and wild fig ; while those
which are moderately moist are suitable for boring
and sawing‚ since dry woods give way beyond the
part which you bore or saw, whereas green woods
except hard oak and box offer a more obstinate re-
sistance, and fill up the teeth of saws in an ineffective
even line3 this is the reason why the teeth are bent
each w av in turn, so as to get rid of the sawdust.

indeed the Gallie ash even has the suppleness
and light weight required for chariots. The elm
would rival it were not its weight against it. Beech
also is easily worked, although brittle and soft3

the only wood suitable for boxes and desks. The
holm-oak as well cuts into extremely thin layers,
and also has a not unattractive colour, but it is most
