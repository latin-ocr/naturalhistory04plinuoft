XXVI. The common kind of paste for paper is made Ραῖξε sor

of fine flour of the best quality mixed with boiling ῬὝΜΜ
w‚ater with a very small sprinkle of vinegar3 for car-
penter' s paste and gum make too brittle a compound.
But a more careful process is to strain the erumb of
leavened bread' in boiling w ater; this method requires
the smallest amount of paste at the seams, and pro-

used ought to be exactly a day old—not more nor yet
less. Afterwards the paper is beaten thin with a
mallet and run over with a lay er of paste, and then

Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus written nearly two

some books ofhis——this was in the consulship of Publius 181 ao.

Baebius Tamphilus, son of Quintus, dating 535 years
after the accession of Numa; and the historiari says
that the books were made of paper, which makes the

matter still more remarkable, because of their having
