XXXIV. And so much for the various classes and Various
kinds of fruits. Their structures call for closer Jffigusfrfffs
examination. Some fruits are characterized by ggfg‘ffpst'l'
their pods, which are themselves sweet and which ’
enclose a seed that is bitter, since whereas in fairly
many plants the seeds are agreeable‚ seeds con-
tained in a pod are not approved of. Others are
characterized by berries which have a hard kernel
inside and flesh outside, for instance olives and
cherries. Some have the berries inside and a hard
shell outside, as is the case with the fruit we spoke
of that grows in Egypt. Fruits of the apple kind xnreo.
have the same structure as the berries: some have
flesh inside and a hard case outside, as in the case
of nuts; while others have flesh outside and a
hard stone inside, as is the case with peaches and
plums, which thus have the refuse part wrapped
round with the fruit, whereas in other cases the fruit
is shielded by the refuse part. Nuts are enclosed in a
shell, chestnuts in a skin; with chestnuts the skin is
removed, but in the case of medlars it is eaten.
Acorns are covered with a hard shell, grapes with a
skin, pomegranates with an outer skin and an inner
skin. Mulberries consist of flesh and juice‚ cherries
of skin and juice‚ Some fruits separate from their
woody part at once, for instance nuts and dateS‚ but
some adhere to it, for instance olives and laurcl-
berries3 and one group has both properties‚ for
example peaches‚ inasmuch as in the hard peach
or nectarine the flesh adhercs and cannot be torn
away from the stone, whereas in all the other
sorts it is easily separated. Some fruits have no
stone inside and no shell outside, for instance the
date class. Of some kinds the hard part itself is
