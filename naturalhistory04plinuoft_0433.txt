specicS, with the exception of the larch, there hang
nut-like growths resembling catkins, packed together
like scales. Those of the male fir have kernels in
their tips, though this is not the case with the female
fir3 but the nuts of the pitch-pine have kerncls filling
the whole of the catkins, which are smaller and
narrower, the kernels being very small and black,
owing to which the Greek name for the pitch-pine
is a word meaning ‘ louse—tree.' Also in the pitch-
pine the nut-growths are more closely packed in the
male trees and less moist with resin.

XX. Moreover, not to pass over any variety, re-
sembling these trees in appearance is the yew, hardly
green at all in colour and slender in form, with a
gloomy, terrifying appearance3 it has no sap, and is
the only tree of all the class that bears berries. The
fruit of the male yew is harmful—in fact its berries,
particularly in Spain, contain a deadly poison3 even
wine-flasks for travellers made of its wood in Gaul
are known to have caused death. Sextius says that
the Greek name for this tree is milax, and that in
Arcadia its poison is so active that people who go to
sleep or picnic beneath a yew-tree die. Some people
also say that this is why poisons were called ‘ taxic,’
which we now pronounce ‘ toxic ’,α meaning ‘ used for
poisoning arrows.’ Ι find it stated that a yew becomes
harmless if a copper nail is driven into the actual tree.

XXI. In Europe tar is obtained from the torch-
pine by heating it, and is used for coating ships’ tackle

chopped up and put into ovens and heated by means
ofa sire packed all round outside. The first liquid that
exudcs flows like water down a pipe; in Syria this is
called ‘ cedar-juice,' and it is so strong that in Egypt
