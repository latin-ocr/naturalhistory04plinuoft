ground. Then they are different in mountain
regions and in the plains, as also they differ in sex
—niale and female, and likewise in flavour: the
sweetest of them all is beech-mast, it being re-
corded by Cornelius Alexander that the people
in the town of Chios actually held out against a siege
by using it for food. It is not possible to distinguish
its kinds by their nameS, which are different in
different places, inasmuch as we see the hard-oak
and the common oak growing everywhere, but the
winter oak not in every region, and the fourth
species of the same class, called the Turkey oak, is
not known at all even to the greater part of Italy.
We will therefore distinguish the varieties by their
properties and natures, also using the Greek names
when necessary.

VII. The acorn of the beech resembles a kernel,
being enclosed in a triangular shell. The leaf,
which is thin and one of the lightest that there are,
resembles that of the poplar3 it turns yellow very
quickly, and on its upper side, usually at the middle,
it grows a little green berry with a pointed end. Mice
are extremely fond of the beech and consequently
in places where it grows these animals abound3 it
also fattens dormice, and is good for thrushes‚ too.
Almost all trees grow a good crop only every other
year, but this is especially the case with the beech.

VIII. The trees that bear acorns in the proper sense

of the term are the hard-oak, the common Oak, the ⁰

winter oak, the Turkey oak‚ the holm-oak and the
cork tree. Tbese trees carry their acorn enclosed in
a bristly cup that embraces more or less of it accord-
ing to their kinds. Their leaves with the exception

of the hohn-oak are heavy, fleshy and tapering‚
