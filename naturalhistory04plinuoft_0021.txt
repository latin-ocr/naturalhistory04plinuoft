BOOK XII. v. 9--11

V. Famous plane-trees are: (1) one that grew in Famons
the walks of the Academy at Athens, the roots of plane-trees.
which were 50 feet long and spread wider than the
branches 3 (2) at the present day there is a celebrated
plane in Lycia, allied with the amenity of a cool
spring3 it stands by the roadside like a dwelling-
house, with a hollow cavity inside it 81 feet across,
forming with its summit a shady grove, and shielding
itself with vast branches as big as trees and covering
the fields with its long shadows‚ and so as to complete
its resemblance to a grotto, embracing inside it mossy
pumice-stenes in a circular rim of rock—a tree so
worthy to be deemed a marvel that Licinius Mucianus,
who was three times consul and recently lieutenant-
governor of the province, thought it worth handing
down to posterity also that he had held a banquet
with eighteen members of his retinue inside the tree,
which itself provided couches of leafage on a bounte-
ous scale, and that he had then gone to bed in the
same tree, shielded from every breath of wind, and
receiving more delight from the agreeable sound of
the rain dropping through the foliage than gleaming
marble, painted decorations or gilded panelling could
have afforded. (3) Another instance is connected
with the Emperor Caligula, who on an estate at
Velletri was impressed by the flooring of a single plane-
tree, and benches laid loosely on beams consisting
of its branches, and held a banquet in the tree—
himself constituting a considerable portion of the
shadow a-in a dining-room large enough to hold
fifteen guests and the servants: this dining-room
the emperor called his ‘ nest.' (4) There is a single
plane-tree at the side of a spring at Gortyn in the
island of Crete which is celebrated in records written
