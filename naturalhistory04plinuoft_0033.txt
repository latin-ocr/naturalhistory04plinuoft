and turns the seeds into barren husks, called bregma,
which is an Indian word meaning ‘ dead.’ Of all
kinds of pepper this is the most pungent and the
lightest, and it is pale in colour. Black pepper is
more agreeable, but white pepper is of a milder
flavour than either the black or the ‘ long ' pepper.
The root of the pepper-trec is not, as some people
have thought, the same as the substance called
ginger, or by others zinpiberi, although it has a

quickly, in spite of its extreme pungency. Its price
is six denarii a pound. It is easy to adulterate long
pepper with Alexandrian mustard. Long pepper is
sold at 15 denarii a pound, white pepper at 7, and
black at 4. It is remarkable that the use of pepper

commodities their sweet taste has been an attraction,
and in others their appearance, but pepper has
nothing to recommend it in either fruit or berry.
To think that its only pleasing quality is pungency

now possesses a pepper-trec that grows larger than a
myrtle, which it somewhat resembles. Its grains
have the same pungency as that believed to belong
to myrtle-pepper‚ but when dried it lacks the ripeness
that the other has, and consequently has not the same
