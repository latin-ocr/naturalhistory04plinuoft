sometimes of a curved shape, The variety of this
class which we offer to the honour of the gods is
called chydaeus α by the Jews, a race remarkable for
their contempt for the divine powers. All over the
Thebaid and Arabia the dates are dry and small,
with a shrivelled body, and as they are seorehed by
the continual heat their covering is more truly a rind
than a skin. Indeed in Ethiopia itself the elimate is
so dry that the skin of these dates is rubbed into
„powder and kneaded to make loaves of bread like
flour. This date grows on a shrub? with branehes
eighteen inehes long, a rather broad leaf, and fruit
of a round shape, but larger than the size of an apple.
The Greek name for this date is koix3 it comes to
maturity in three years, and the shrub always has
fruit on it, another date sprouting in place of one
picked. The date of the Thebaid is packed into
casks at once, before it has lost the aroma of its
natural heat3 if this is not done, it quickly loses its
freshness and dries up unless it is wal-med up again
m an oven.

Of the rest of the date kind the Syrian variety,
called sweetmeats‚ seem to be a low-class fruit3 for
those in the other part of Phoenicia and Cilicia have
the local name of amm-dates, also used by us.
These too are of several kinds, differing in shape,
some rounder and others longer, and also in colour‚
some being blacker and others reddish3 indeed,
they are reported to have as many varieties of
eolour as the fig, though the white ones are the
most in favour. They also differ in size, many having
reached half a yard in length while some are no
larger than a bean. The best kinds for keeping are
those that grow in salt and sandy soils, for instance
