BOOK XV. 11. 4—111. 7

Virgil ⁰ said that there are three kinds of olive, the
orchites,⁶ the shuttle-olive ⁶ and the posia3d he also
stated that the olive-tree does not require raking or
pruning or any attention. There is no doubt that
even in the case of olives the soil and the climate are
of very great importance3 but nevertheless they
are also pruned at the same time as the vine, and
they like the ground to be raked between them as
well. Olive-picking follows the vintage, and making
olive-oil requires even more science than making
wine, as the same olive-tree produces a variety of oils.
The first oil of all is obtained from the raw olive and
when it has not yet begun to ripen—this has the best
flavour3 moreover its first issue from the press is the
richest, and so on by diminishing stages, whether the
olives are crushed in wicker sieves or by enclosing
the spray in narrow-meshed strainers, a method
recently invented. The riper the berry is, the
greasier and less agreeable in flavour is the juice.
The best age for picking olives, as between quantity
and flavour, is when the berry is beginning to turn
black, at the stage when they are called druppae with
us and drypetides by the Greeks. For the rest, it
makes a difference at that stage whether the maturing
ofthe berry takes place in the presses or on the boughs,
and whether the tree has been watered or the berry
has only been moistened by its own juice and has
drunk nothing else but the dews of heaven.

ΙΙΙ. It is not the same with olive-oil as with wine olive-011.-
—age gives it an unpleasant flavour, and at the end ἴνᾚξεζῗ
of a year it is already old. Herein, if one chooses
to understand it, Nature shows her forethought,
inasmuch as there is no necessity to use up wine,
which is produced for the purpose of intoxication
