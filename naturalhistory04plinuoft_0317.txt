possible complete cleanlincss may be produced. It
was a later discovery, he says, to wash the olives in
absolutely boiling water, and at once put thern whole
into the press—for that method crushes out the lees
—and then to crush them in oil-mills and put them
under the press a second time. People do not
approve of pressing more than a hundred pecks of
olives at a time: this is called a ‘ batch,’ and what is
squeezed out first after the millstone is called the
‘ flower.’ It is a fair amount for three batches to be
pressed in twenty-four hours by gangs of four men
using a double holder.‘²

which are produced from trees, and among them
before all from the wild olive. It is a thin oil‚ and
has a much more bitter flavour than the oil obtained
from the cultivated olive, and it is only useful for
medicines. Very closely resembling this oil is the
oil obtained from the ground-olive, a rock shrub not
more than three inches high, with leaves and fruit
like those of the wild olive. The next class of oil is
that obtained from the cici? a tree growing in great
abundance in Egypt—others call it the croton, others
sibi, others wild sesame——and there, as well as not
long ago in Spain also, it grows wild, shooting up as
high as an olive-tree, with a stalk like that of the
fennel, the leaf of a vine, and a seed—pod like a
slender grape of a pale colour: our countrymen call
it the tick, from the resemblance of the seed-pod to
that insect. It is boiled in water and the oil floating
on the surface is skimmed off. But in Egypt, where
