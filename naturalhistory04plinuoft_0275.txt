bear children in women and madness in men ; where-
as in Achaia, particularly in the neighbourhood of
Carynia‚ there is a wine that is reported to prevent
child-bearing, and this even if women eat the grapes
when they are pregnant, although these do not differ
in taste from ordinary grapes. It is said that per-
sons who drink the wine of Troezen cannot become
parents. The people of Thasos are reported to
make two different kinds of wine, a wine that brings
sleep and another that banishes sleep. The same
place has a vine called in Greek the ‘ wild-animal
vine‚' ‘² the wine made from which and also its
grapes cure snake—bites, and another the ‘ frankin—
cense vine‚’ with a scent like that of incense, the
wine from which is used for libations to the gods.
That of the vine called ‘uneonsecrated,'b on the
contrary, is banned from the altars3 also it is said
that no bird will touch it. Egypt gives the name of
‘ wine of Thasos ' to an extremely sweet native vin-
tage which causes diarrhoea; while Lycia on the
contrary has one that has an astringent effect on the
bowels. Egypt also possesses a wine called in Greek
‘ delivery wine ' which causes abortion. There are
certain wines that, while stored in wine-lofts alter in
quality at the rising of the Dog-star and afterwards
change back again; the same is the case with wines
shipped over sea, and it is obscrved that the effect of
the motion on vintages that can stand it is merely to
double their previous maturity.
