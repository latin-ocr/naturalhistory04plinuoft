oak, the pitch-pine, the larch and the pine do not
bedeck themselves with any blossom or announce
the yearly birthdays of their fruit by a many- -coloured
harbinger, nor yet do the cultivated and the wild
fig, for they produce their fruit straight away in-
stead of a blossom, and' 111 the case of the fig it is also
remarkable that there are abortive fruits that never
ripen. The juniper also does not blossom—though
some writers record two kinds of juniper, one of which
flowers but does not bear, and one which does not
flower but does bear, its berries coming to birth
immediately, which remain on the tree for two
years3 but this is a mistake, and all the junipers
present the same gloomy aspect always. Similarly,
the fortunes of many human beings also lack a
flowering season.

XLI. All trees however produce buds, even those Various
which do not blossom. Tbere 1s also a great difference ῗῇᾗάῂ, ⁰f
between localities, inasmuch as of the same kind
of tree those growing in marshy places bud earlier,
those on the plains next and those in woods last of

wind begins to blow, next the laurel, and a little
before the equinox the lime and maple—-while
among the earliest trees to flower are the poplar,
elm, willow, alder and the nuts, · the plane also buds
quickly. Τ116 other trees bud when spring is about
to begin, the holly, terebinth, Christ's thorn, chest-
nut and the acorn- bearing trees, while the apple is a
late budder‚ and the cork buds latest of all. Some Later
trees bud twice, owing to excessive fertility of soil ‘md ΜΨ·

to a greater degree with the young blades of cereals,
