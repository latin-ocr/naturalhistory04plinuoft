BOOK XII. LI. 109—L1v. 111

LI. A tree found in Egypt is the cypros,‘² which

has the leaves of the jujube-tree and the white,
scented seed of the coriander. Cypros-seed is boiled
in olive oil and afterwards crushed, producing the
cypros of commerce, which sells at 5 denarii a pound.
The best is made from the tree grown at Canopus on
the banks of the Nile, the second best at Ascalon in
J udaea‚ and the third quality on the island of
Cyprus, which has a sort of sweet scent. The
cypros is said to be the same as the thorn called
privet in Italy.

LII. In the same region grows the aspalathus‚ a Scented
white thorn of the size of a moderate- sized tree, ‘'um''
with the flower of a rose· ‚ the root is in request for
unguents. People say that any shrub over which a
rainbow forms its arch gives out a scent as sweet as
that of the aspalathuS, but that if this happens in the
case of an aspalathus a scent rises that is indescribably
sweet. Some call this shrub red sceptre and others
sceptre. The test of its genuineness lies in its fiery
red colour, firmness to the touch and scent like
that of beaver-oil. It is sold for 5 denarii a
pound. LIII. Cat-thyme ὓ also grows in Egypt,
though not so good a kind as the Ly dian variety,
its leaves being larger and variegated; those of the
Lydian are short and very small, and have a strong
scent.
