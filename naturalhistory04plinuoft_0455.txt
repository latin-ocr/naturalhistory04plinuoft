and it makes no difference if they budded earlier,
inasmuch as some trees are the first to bud and
among the last to be strippcd of their leaves, for
instance almonds, ash—trees‚ elders, whereas the
mulberry is the latest to bud and one of the first
to shed its leaves. The soil also has a great influence
in this matter: the leaves fall earlier on dry, thin soils,
and earlier with an old tree, in many cases even
before the fruit can ripen, for instance, in the case
of the late fig and the winter pear and apple, and
with the pomegranate the fruit is the only thing
visible on the parent tree. But not even with the
trees that always keep their foliage do the same
leaves last on with others shooting up beneath them
—when this happens the old leaves wither away,
this occurring mostly about the solstices.

poplar, the ivy and the croton (which, as we have said, XV· 24·
is also called the cici). There are three kinds of
poplars, the white, the black and the one called the
Libyan poplar, which has a very small and very dark
leaf and which is very famous for the mushrooms
that grow on it. The white poplar has a leaf of two
colours‚ white on the upper side and green under-
neath. With this tree and the black poplar and the
croton the· leaves are exactly circular when young but
project into angles when older; whereas the leaves
of the ivy' are angular at first but become round.
From the leaves of the white poplar springs out a
quantity of shiny white down, and when the foliage
is specially thick the trees are white all over like
fleeces. Pomegranate and almond trees have reddish
