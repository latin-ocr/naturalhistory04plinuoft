ceptional strength3 the smaller of these ‘twins ' is
damaged by a south wind, but the other winds give
it nutriment‚ for instance on Mount Vesuvius and
the hills of Sorrento, but in all other parts of Italy
it only flourishes when trained on trees. The fifth
kind is the ‘ woolly ' grape—for, to prevent our being
very much surprised at the Chinese or the Indians‚“
it is covered with a coat of down. It ripens first of
the Aminaean grapes‚ and decays the most quickly.

The next rank belongs to the vines of Mentana, the
wood of which is red, in consequence of which some
people have called them the ‘ ruddy vines.’ These
produce less wine, as they have too much husk and
lees, but they are very strong in resisting frost, and
they suffer worse from drought than rain and from heat
than cold, and consequently they hold the first place
in cold and damp localities. The variety with a
smaller berry is more productive‚ and the one with a
cleft leaf less.

The ‘ bee-vine ’ὂ is so called because bees are
specially fond of it. It has two varieties, which also
are covered with down in the young state3 the
difference between them is that one ripens more
quickly than the other, although the latter also ripens
fast. These vines do not object to cold situations,
and nevel-theless no others rot more quickly from
rain. The wines made from them are sweet at first
but acquire roughness in the course of years. In
Tuscany this vine flourishes more than any other.

So far we assign the chief distinction to the vines
peculiar and indigenous to Italy. The remaining kinds
have come from abroad. From Chios or Thasos is
imported a Greek light wine not inferior in quality to
the Aminaean vintages3 the vine has a very tender
