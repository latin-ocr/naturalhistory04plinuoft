BOOK XVI. Lxxv. 194-Lxxw. 196

the seven days next after full moon are the best
for removing it. Beware absolutely of rough-
hewing or cutting or touching any timber unless it
is dry, and when it is frozen or wet with dew.’
Similarly the emperor Tiberius kept to the period
between two moons even in having his hair cut.
Marcus Varro advises the plan of having one’s hair
cut just after full moon, as a precaution against
going bald.

LXXVI. W hen the laroh and still more the silver fir Laron ana
has been felled, a liquid α flows from them for a long ῗζὲἶξγαξζε

time. These are the tallest and the straightest of all and habitus

the trees. For the masts and spars of ships the fir is
preferred because of its light weight. A property
shared by these trees and also by the pine is that
of having veins running through the wood in four
or in two divisions‚ or else only in one line. The
interior in the four-veined kind is the best timber
to cut up for inlaid wood-work and that in the two-
veined the worst,b and softer than the other kinds;
experts can tell them at once from the bark. Fir
wood from the part of the tree that was near the
ground is free from knots. This timber after being
floated in a river in the way which we have de-
scribed is cleared of bulges‚ and when so treated §186-
is called sappinus, while the upper part which is
knotted and harder is called club-wood. More-
over in the trees themselves the parts towards
the north-east are stronger; and in general trees
from damp and shady places are inferior and
those from sunny places are closer grained and
durable; on this account at Rome fir from the
Tuscan coast is preferred to that from the
Adriatic.
