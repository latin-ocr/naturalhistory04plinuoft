exudes a small quantity when exposed to the action
of the sun. The wood, on the contrary, which in the
case of the fir is extremely beautiful, in the pitch-
pine only serves for making split roos-shingles and
tubs and a few other articles ofjoinery.

XIX. The fifth kind of resinous tree has the same ar

habitat and the same appearance3 it is called the
larch. Its timber is far superior, not rotting with age
and offering a stubborn resistance to damp3 also
it has a reddish colour and a rather penetrating
scent. Resin flows from this tree in rather large
quantities‚ of the colour and stickiness of honey,
and never becoming hard.

The sixth kind is the torch-pinea specially so called,
which gives out more resin than the rest, but less,
and of a more liquid kind, than the pitch—pine3 and
it is agreeable for kindling fires and also for torch-
light at religious ceremonies. These trees, at all
events the male variety, also produce the extremely
strong-smelling liquid called by the Greeks syce.⁶
It is a disease of the larch to turn into a torch-pine.

All these kinds of trees when set fire to make an
enormous quantity of sooty smoke and suddenly
with an explosive crackle send out a splutter of
charcoal and shoot it to a considerable distance—-
excepting the larch, which does not burn nor yet
make charcoal‚ nor waste away from the action
of fire any more than do stones. All these trees ⁶ are
evergreen, and are not easily distinguishable in
point of foliage even by experts, so closely are they
interrelated3 but the pitch-pine is not so tall as the
larch, which has a thicker and smoother bark and
more velvety and oilier and thicker foliage, the leaf
bending more softly to the touch, whereas the foliage
