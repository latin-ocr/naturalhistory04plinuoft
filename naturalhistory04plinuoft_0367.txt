dealing with grafting‚the Etereian‚ which its red skin
renders more popular than the three-cornered chest-
nut and the common black ones called cooking chest-
nuts. The most highly commended chestnuts come
from Taranto, and in Campania from Naples ; all the
other kinds are grown for pig-food ; the pigs carefully

XXVI. Also the extremely sweet carob may be
thought to be not far remote from the chestnut‚
except that in the case of the carob the husk itself
is eaten. It is not longer than a man’s finger, and
occasionally curved like a sickle, and it has the
thickness of a man's thumb. Acorns cannot be
counted among fruits, and consequently they will
be dealt with among trees of their own kind.

XXVII. The remaining fruits belong to the fleshy
class, and they differ in their shape and in their flesh.
Berries ⁰ have one kind offlesh, the mulberry another,
the strawberry-tree another3 and the grape, etc.,
have a substance between skin and juice different
frorn that of the myxa plum and from that of berries
such as the olive. The flesh of the mulberry contains
a vinous juice, and the fruit has three successive
colours‚ first white, then red, and when ripe black.
The mulberry is one of the latest trees to blossom,
but among the first to ripen. The juice of ripe
mulberries stains the hand, but the stain can be
washed out with the juice of unripe 01165. Ι11 the
case of this tree the devices of the growers have made
the least improvement of any, and the mulberry
of Ostia and that of Tivoli do not differ from that of
Rome by named varieties or by grafting or in any
other way except in the size of the fruit. A similar
but much firmer berry b also grows on brambles.
