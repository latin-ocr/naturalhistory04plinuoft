for a great many purposeS. The kind grown on
Ida in the 'l'road so closely resembles cedar—wood
that when the bark has been removed it deceives
buyers. The Greeks have distinguished two kinds
of ash-tree‚ a tall one without knots and the other
a short tree with harder and darker wood and
foliage like that of the bay-tree. In Macedonia
there is a very large ash making very flexible timber,
which has the Greek name of ‘ ox-ash.’ Other people
have distinguished the ash-tree by locality‚ as they
say that the ash of the plains has a crinkly grain
and the mountain ash is close-grained. Greek
writers have stated that the leaves of the ash are
poisonous to beasts of burden, though doing no harm
to all the other kinds of ruminants3 but in Italy
they are harmless to beasts of burden also. Indeed,
they are found to be serviceable as an exceptionally
effective antidote for snake-bites, if the juice is
squeezed out to make a potion and the leaves are
applied to the wound as a poultice3 and they are so
potent that a snake will not come in contact with the
shadow of the tree even in the morning or at sunset
when it is at its longest‚ so wide a berth does it give
to the trec itself. We can state from actual experi-
ment that if a ring of ash-leaves is put round a fire
and a snake, the snake will rather escape into the
fire than into the asli-leaves. By a marvellous pro-
vision of Nature's kindness the ash flowers before
the snakes come out and does not shed its leaves
before they have gone into hibernation.

are entirel3 different. Not only is the wood of the
male lime hard and reddish and knotted and more
scented, but also the bark is thicker‚ and when
