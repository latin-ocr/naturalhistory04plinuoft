BOOK xlv. v. 4851

Sthenelus, a plebeian, the son of a freedman, by his
intensive cultivation of a vineyard of not more than
60 iugera, in the region of Mentana, which he sold
for 400,000 sesterces. Also Vetulenus Aegialus,
he too a freedman, gained a great reputation in
the district of Liternum in Campania, and a still
greater reputation in public esteem on account of his
cultivating the estate which had been the place of
exile of Africanus ‘²3 but the greatest reputation,
thanks to the activity of the same Sthenelus, attached
to Remmius Palaemon, also famous for his treatise on
grammar, who within the last 20 years bought a farm
for 600,000 sesterces in the same region of Mentana,
at the turning off the main road ten miles from Rome.
ΤΙὶε low price of property through all the districts
just outside the city in every direction is notorious,
but especially in the neighbourhood referred to, since
Palaemon had bought farms that had also been let
down by neglect and that were not above the average
quality of soil even among those extremely poor
estates. He undertook the cultivation of this
property not from any high motive but at first out of
vanity, for which he was known to be so remarkable3
but he had the vineyards dug and trenched afresh
under the superintendence of Sthenelus, and so,

though only playing the part of a farmer, he finally
got the estate into an almost incredibly wonderful
condition, as within eight years, the vintage, vahile
still hanging on the trees, was knocked down to a
purchaser at a price of 400, OOO sesterces, and ev ery-

body ran to see the piles of grapes in these viney ards,

while the sluggish neighbourhood vindicated itself
against this discredit by the excuse of his exception-
