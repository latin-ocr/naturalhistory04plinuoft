loosened with a blow, but not removed. From
the incision a greasy foam spurts out, which co-
agulates and thickens, being received on 3 mat of
palm-leaves where the nature of the ground requires
this, but in other places on a space round the tree
that has been rammed hard. The frankincense
collected in the latter way is in a purer state, but
the former method produces a heavier weight3 while
the residue adhering to the tree is scraped off with
an iron tool, and consequently contains fragments of
bark. The forest is divided up into definite portions,
and owing to the mutual honesty of the owners is
free from trespassing, and though nobody keeps guard
over the trees after an incision has been made,
nobody steals from his neighbour. At Alexandria, on
the other hand, where the frankincense is worked up
for sale, good heavens! no vigilance is sufficient to
guard the factories. A seal is put upon the work-
men's aprons, they have to wear a mask or a net
with 3 close mesh on their heads, and before they
are allowed to leave the premises they have to take
off all their clothes: so much less honesty is dis-
played with regard to the produce with thern than
as to the forests with the growers. The frankin-
cense from the summer crop is collected in autumn3
this is the purest kind, bright white in colour. The
second crop is harvested in the spring, cuts having
been made in the bark during the winter in
preparation for it3 the juice that comes out on this
occasion is reddishâ€š and not to be compared with
the former taking, the name for which is carfiathum,
the other being called dathiathum. Also the juice
produced by a sapling is believed to be whiter, but
that from an older trec has more scent. Some
