BOOK XVI. Lxxw. 191-Lxxv. 194

If conjunctions should coincide with the shortest day
of the winter solstice, the timber produced lasts for
ever3 and the next best is when the conjunction
coincides with the constellations mentioned above.
Some people add the rising of the Dog-star also,
and say that this was how the timber used for the
Forum of Augustus was felled. But trees that are
neither quite young nor old are the most useful
for timber. Another plan not without value is
followed by some people, who make a cut round
the trees as far as the pith and then leave them
standing, so that all the moisture may drain out of
them. It is a remarkable fact that in old days in
the first Punic War the fleet commanded by Duilius ‘²
was on the water within 60 days after the timber
left the tree, while, according to the account of
Lucius Piso, the 220 ships that fought against
King Hiero ὁ were built in 45 days 3 also in the second
Punic war Scipio’s fleet sailed on the 40th day after
the timber had been felled. So effective is prompt
action even in the hurry of an emergency.

LXXV. Cato, the leading authority on timber in
all its useS‚ adds the following advice0: ‘ Make a
press of black fir wood for choice. With elm,
pine or walnut timber, when you are going to root
up these or any other tree, take them up when the
moon is waning, in the afternoon, when there is not
a south wind. A tree will be ready for felling when
its seed is ripe. And be careful not to haul a tree or
trim it with the axe when there is a dew.' And
the same writer latera: ⁴ Do not touch timber ex-
cept at new moon, or else at the end of the
moon's second quarter3 with timber which you dig
up by the roots or cut off level with the ground,
