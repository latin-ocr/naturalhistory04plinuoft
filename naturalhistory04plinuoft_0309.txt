wait for the olives to fall off, for by remaining attached
to the branches beyond their proper time they use
up the nourishment for the coming crop and occupy
its place: this is proved by the fact that if they are
not gathered before the west wind blows they acquire
renewed strength and fall off with greater difficulty.
IV. Well then, the first olive gathered after the Vqrietiesvos
beginning of autumn is the posia, which owing to a ᾤ’ζῖξηηὲξξῆ
faulty method of cultivation and not to any fault of flammine}-
nature, is a very fleshy fruit3 next the orchiteS‚
which contains a great deal of oil, and after that the
radius. For as these olives are very delicate the lees
in them very quickly gets hold of them and cause
them to fall off. But the gathering of the hard-
skinned olives, which strongly resist damp and conse-
quently are very small, is put off even till the month
of March ‚ the Licinian‚ Cominian, Contian and Sergian
kinds, the last called by the Sabines the ‘ royal olivc,’
not turning black before the west wind blows‚ that
is before February 8. It is thought that they begin
to ripen then, and as a very excellent oil is made
from them reason also appears to reinforce this mis-
take3 and people say that the cold causes harshness
in the oil in the same degree as the ripening of the
berry increases the quantity, whereas in reality the
goodness of the oil is not a matter of the time of
gathering but of the kind of olive, which is slow in
decaying in-to lees. A similar mistake is made in
keeping the olives when gathered on wooden shelvcs
and not crushing them till they sweat out juice‚
inasmuch as all delay diminishes the yield of oil and
increases the quantity of lees. The consequence is
the common assertion that a peck of olives yields
only sis< pounds of oil; but nobody measures the
