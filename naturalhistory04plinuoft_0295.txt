BOOK XIV. xxvm. 146-148

even this science has its own code of rules—of never
having stammered in his speech or relieved himself
by vomiting or otherwise while he was drinking, but of
having always turned up for duty with the morning
guard without anything going wrong, and of having
drunk the largest quantity on record at one draught
and also added to the record by some more smaller
draughts, of not having taken breath or spat while
drinking (this on the best evidence), and of not
having left any heel-taps to make a splash in the paved
floor—under the elaborate code of rules to prevent
cheating in drinking. Tergilla brings it up against
Marcus Cicero that his son Cicero was in the habit
of tossing off a gallon and a half at one draught,
and that when tipsy he threw a goblet at Marcus
Agrippa t these in fact are the usual results ofintoxi-
cation. But no doubt young Cicero wanted to deprive
his father's murderer, Mark Antony, of his fame in
this department3 for Antony had strained every
effort to win the championship in this field before
him, by actually publishing a book on the subject of
his own drunken habits3 and by venturing to cham-
pion his claims in this volume, to my mind he clearly
proves the magnitude ofthe evils that he had inflicted
on the world through his tippling. It was shortly
before the battle of Actium that he vomited up this
volume, so proving clearly that he was already drunk
m‘th the blood of his compatriots, and that that made
him only the more thirsty for it. For in fact the
inevitable result of this vice is that the habit of
drinking increases the appetite for it, and it was a
shrewd observation of the Scythian ambassador that
the more the Parthians drank the thirstier they
became.
