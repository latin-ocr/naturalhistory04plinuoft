length according to the variety of their kinds.

There are two classes of holm-oak. The Italian
variety, called by some Greeks milax, has a leaf not
very different from ’that of the olive, but the holm-
oak in the provinces is the one with pointed leaves.
The acorn of both kinds is shorter and more slen-

bears no acorns.

The best and largest acorn grows on the common

the hard-oak is small, and that of the Turkey oak

of the chestnut. But also in the case of the oak
in general the acorn of the female tree is sweeter
and softer, while that of the male tree is more
compact. In the most esteemed variety called de-
scriptively the broad-leaved oak, the acorns differ
among themselves in size and in the thinness of
their shell, and also in that some have under the
shell a rough coat of a rusty colour, whereas in
others one comes to the white flesh at once. Those
acorns are also esteemed the kernel of which at
each extremity taken lengthwise has a stony hard-
ness, those having this in the husk being better than
those with it in the flesh of the nut, but in either
