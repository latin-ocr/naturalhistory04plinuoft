sea- going vessels, and the same with all woods
except thc wild and the cultivated olive3 in fact
some woods are more liable to faults in the sea and
others 1n the ground.

LXXX. There arc four kinds of pests that attack
timbers. Borer-worms α have a very large head in pro·-
portion to their size, and gnaw away wood with their
teeth3 these worms are observed only in the sea,
and it is held that they are the only ones to which
the name of borer-worm properly applies. The land
variety are called moths‚ but the name for those
resembling gnats is thrips, and there is also a fourth
kind belonging to the maggot class, of which some
are engendered by the wood itself when its sap
becomes putrid and others are produced by the
worm called horned-worm——as they are in trees——
which when it has gnawed away enough to be able
to turn round, gives birth to another. The birth
of these insects is prevented however in some trees,
for instance the cypress, by the bitter taste of the
wood, and in others, for instance the box, by its
hardness. It is also said that the fir will not decay
in water if about the time of budding and at the
lunar period we stated it is stripped of its bark. The
companions of Alexander the Great stated that on
the island of Tylosb in the Red Sea there are treesc
used for building ships, the timbers of which have
been found continuing free from rot for two hundred
years even though they were under water. They
further reported& that the same island contains a
shrub growing only thick enough for a walking
stick, marked with stripes like a tiger skin, heavy
and liable to break like glass when it falls on to
things of harder substance.
