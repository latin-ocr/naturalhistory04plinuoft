but as to the actual statue of the goddess there is
some dispute, all the other writers saying that it is
made of ebony, but one of the people who have
most recently seen it and written about it, Mucianus,
who was three times consul, states that it is made of

although the temple has been restored seven times3
and that this material was chosen by Endoeus—

not only Father Liber but Minerva also. He adds
that nard is poured into it through a number of
apertures so that the chemical properties of the
liquid may nourish the wood and keep the joins

that there should be any a--—and that the folding
doors are made of cypress wood, and the whole of
the timber looks like new wood after having lasted
nearly 400 years. It is also worth noting that the
doors were kept for four years in a frame of glue.

Numidian cedar have lasted for 1178 years just
as they were when they were put in position at the
original foundation of that city3 and the temple
of Diana at Saguntum in Spain, the statue of the
goddess, according to the authority of Bocchus,
