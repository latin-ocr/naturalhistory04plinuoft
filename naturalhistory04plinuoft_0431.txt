and of a colder nature, and the whole tree is rougher
and is covered with resin; the wood more resembles
that of the fir. When the roots of a larch have been
burnt it does not throw out fresh shoots, but the
pitch-pine doeS, as happened on the island of Lesbos
after the grove of the town of Pyrrha had been
burnt. Moreover there is another difference within
these species themselves in the matter of sex: the
male tree is shorter and has harder leaves, while the
female is taller and its leaves are more unctuous and
not forked and not stiff 3 and the wood of the male
is hard, and when used in carpentry splits crooked,
while that of the female is softer, the manifestation
of the difference resting with the axe, which in every
variety detects the male, because it meets with re-
sistance and falls with a louder crash and is pulled
out of the wood with greater difficulty. With the
male trees the wood itself is patched and blacker in
colour. In the neighbourhood of Mount Ida in the
Troad there is also another variation among the
larches, the mountain larch and the coast larch being
different. As for Macedonia and Arcadia and the
neighbourhood of Elis, in these places the varieties
exchange names and the authorities are not agreed

our part we settle that sort of question by the
verdict of Rome.

The biggest ofthe entire gronp is the fir, the female
being even taller than the male, and its timber softer
and more easily worked, and the tree rounder in
shape, and with dense feathery foliage, which makes
it impervious to rain3 and in general it has a more
cheerful appearance. From the branches of these
