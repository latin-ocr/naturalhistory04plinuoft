BOOK XIV. xxm. 119-XX1v. 121

XXIII. And since life is upheld by religion it is
considered sinful to pour libations to thc godS‚ not
only with wines made from a vine that has not been
pruned, but from one that has been struck by light-
ning, or one in the neighbourhood of which a man has
been hanged, or wine made from grapes that have
been trodden out by somcone with sore feet, or
squcezed from grape-skins that have been cut round α
or have been soiled by something not quite clean
dropping on them from above3 and likewise Greek
wines must not be used for libations, because they
contain water.

The vine itselfis also eaten,the tops ofthe shoots be-
ing boiled3 they are also pickled in vinegar and brine.

XXIV. But it may also bc proper to give an account
of the method of preparing wine, as Greek authors
have written special treatises on this subject and have
made a scientific system for it———for instance Euphron-
iu5, Aristomachus, Commiades and Hicesius. The
practice in Africa is to soften any roughness with
gypsum, and also in some parts of the country with
lime. In Greece, on the other hand, they enliven
the smoothness of their wines with potter’s earth or
marble dust or salt or sea-water, while in some parts
of Italy they use resinous b pitch for this purpose, and
it is the general practice both there and in the neigh-
bouring provinces to Season must with resin; in
some places they use the lees of older wine or else
vinegar for seasoning. Moreover, medicaments for
this purpose are also made from the must itself: it
is boiled down so as to become sweeter in proportion
to its strength, and it is said that must so treated
does not last beyond a year’s time. In some places
they boil the must down into what is called sapa,
