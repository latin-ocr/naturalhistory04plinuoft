BOOK XII. xxvn. 47—xxvn1. 49

XXVII. Hazelwort also has the property of nard, Ilazelwort·
indeed some people actually call it ‘ wild nard.' It
has the leaves of the ivy, only rounder and softer, a
purple flower, the root of Gallic nard, and seed like
grape-stones‚ which has a warm taste with a flavour
of wine. On shady mountains it flowers twice a
year. The best variety grows in Pontus, the next
best in Phrygia and the third in Illyricum. WVhen it
begins to shed its leaves it is dug up and dried in the
sun, as it quickly becomes mouldy and loses its
strength. A plant has also lately been found in
Thrace the leaves of which do not differ at all from
the Indian nard.

XXVIII. The clustered amomuma is much in use3 Amomum-
it is obtained from the Indian wild-vine, or 33 other
people have supposed from a twisted shrub a hand
high, and it is plucked with its root and then gently
pressed together into bundles, as it is liable to
break at once. The kind most highly spoken of
is the one with leaves like those of the pomegranate
and devoid of wrinkles, coloured red. The second
best kind is of a pale colour3 the grass—coloured one
is not so good, and the white kind is the worst3
it also goes white with age. The price of clustered
amomum is 60 denarii a pound, but as dust it fetches
only 48 denarii. It grows in the part of Armenia
called Otene, and also in Media and in Ροῐ1ῒιι3.ὁ
It is adulterated with the leaves of the pome-
granate and with liquid gum to make the leaves stick
together and form a cluster like a bunch of grapes.

There is also another substance called amomis, Amomis.
which is not so full of veins and is harder and has
less scent, showing that it is either a different plant
or amomum that has been gathered unripe.
