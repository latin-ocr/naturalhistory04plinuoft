BOOK ΧΙΙ. xxxv. 70—xxxw. 72

ΤῙιε prices vary with the supply of buyers ; that of Prices ο]
stacte ranges from 3 to 50 denarii apound, whereas the myrrh.
top price for cultivated myrrh is 11 denarii and for
Erythrean 16—this kind is passed off as Arabian—
and for the kernel of Cave-dweller 1623, but for the
variety called scented myrrh 12. Myrrh is adulter-
ated with lumps of lentisk and with gum, and also
with cucumber juice to give it a bitter taste, as it is
with litharge of silver to increase its weight. The
rest of the impurities can be detected by taste,
and gum by its sticking to the teeth. But the
adulteration most difficult to detect is that prac-
tised in the case of Indian myrrh, which is col-
lected in India from a certain thorn-bush 3 this is the
only commodity iniported from India that is of
worse quality than that of other countries—indeed
it is easily distinguished because it is so very
inferior.

XXXVI. Consequently Indian myrrh passes over Mastich.
into ‘² mastich, which is also obtained from a thorn
in India, and in Arabia as well; it is called laina.
Of mastich also there are two kinds, since in Asia
and Greece there is also found a plant sending out
from its root leaves and a prickly head like an apple,
full of seed and of juice which spurts out when an
incision is made in the top, so that it can scarcely be
distinguished from true mastich. Moreover, there
is also a third kind innPontus which is more like bitu-
men ; but the kind most highly praised is the white
mastich of Chios, which fetches a price of 10 denarii
a pound, while the black kind costs 2 denarii. It is
said that the Chian mastich exudes from the lentisk
like a kind of gum. Like frankincense it is adulter-
ated with resin.
