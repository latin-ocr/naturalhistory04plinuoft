XXIX. The nations of thc west also have their own
intoxicant, made from grain soakcd in water3 there
are a number of ways of making it in the various pro-
vinces of Gaul and Spain and under different names,
although the principle is the same. The Spanish
provinces have by this time even taught us that these
liquors will bear being kept a long time. Egypt also
has devised for itself similar drinks made from grain,
and in no part of the world is drunkenness ever out
of action, in fact they actually quaff liquors of this
kind neat and do not temper their strength by dilut-
ing them, as is done with wine3 yet, by Hercules,
it used to be thought that the product of the earth
in that country was corn. Alas, what wonderful
ingenujty vice possesses ! a method has actually
been discovered for making even water intoxicated l

There are two liquids that are specially agreeablc
to the human body, wine inside and oil outside, both
of them the most excellent of all the products of the
tree class, but oil an absolute necessity, nor has man’s
life been slothful in expending labour upon it. How
much more ingenious, however, man has been in
respect of drink will be made clear by the fact that
he has devised 185 kinds of beverages (or if varieties
be reckoned, almost double that number), and so
much less numerous kinds of cil—about which we
shall speak in the following volume.
