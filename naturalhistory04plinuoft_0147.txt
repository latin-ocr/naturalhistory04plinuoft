been called by some the Egyptian fig. But this is
clearly a mistake, as it does not grow in Egypt but
in Syria and Ionia, and also in the neighbourhood of
Cnidus and on the island of Rhodes. It is always in
full foliage, and it has a white flower with a powerful
scent. It sends out shoots at the lower parts, and
consequently is of a yellow colour above ground, as
the suckers drain away the sap. If the fruit of the
preceding year is picked about the rising of the Dog-
star‚ it at once grows a second crop, after which it
blossoms through the period of the Bear—ward, and
the winter nourishes its fruit.

called the persea‚‘¹ which resembles a pear but is an persea,

evergreen. It bears fruit without intermission, as
when it is plucked a fresh crop sprouts the next day,
but its season for ripening is when the midsummer
winds are blowing. The fruit is longer than a pear,
and is enclosed in a shell like an almond and a rind
the colour of grass, but where the almond has a
kernel this has a plum, which differs from an almond
kernel in being short and soft, and although tempt-
ingly sweet and luscious, is quite wholesome. The
wood is just like that of the lotus for goodness and
soundness and also in its black colour, and it too
has habitually been used for making statues. The
timber of the tree we have mentioned called the
bchenmut, although reliable‚ is not so highly valued,
as a large proportion of it has a twisted grain, so it is
only used for ship-building. XVIII. But on the con-
trary the eueib is in great esteem; this tree re-
sembles a palm in that its leaves are also used for
textiles, but it differs because it spreads out into
branches like arms. The fruit is of a size that fills
