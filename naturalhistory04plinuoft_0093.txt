and it is a remarkable fact that ever since the time
of Pompey the Great even trees have figured among
the captives in our triumphal processions. The
balsam-tree is now a subject of Rome, and pays tri-
bute together with the race to which it belongs; it
differs entirely in character from the accounts that
had been given of it by Roman and foreign writers,
being more like a vine than a myrtle: it has quite
recently been taught to grow from mallet-shoots tied
up on trellises like a vine, and it covers whole hill-
sides as vineyards do. A balsam unsupported by a
trellis and carrying its own weight is pruned in a
similar manner when it puts out shoots3 the use of
the rake makes it thrive and sprout rapidly, bearing
in its third year. Its leaf is very near that of the
tuber-apple,“ and it is an evergreen. The Jews
vented their wrath upon this plant as they also did
upon their own lives, but the Romans protected it
against them, and there have been pitched battles
in defence of a shrub. It is now cultivated by the
treasury authorities, and ‘was never before more
plentiful; but its height has not advanced beyond
three feet.

There are three varieties of balsam—tree: one Varietiesos
with thin foliage like hair, called easy-to-gather3 baisam.
another with a rugged appearance, curving over, of
a bushy growth and with a stronger scent—they
call this rough balsam, and the third tall balsam
because it grows higher than the rest3 this has a
smooth bark. This last is the second best in quality,
and the easy-to-gather kind is the lowest grade.
Balsam- seed tastes very like wine, and has a red
colour and a rather greasy consistency3 that con-
