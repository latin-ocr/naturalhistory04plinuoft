BOOK XII. xx1. 38—xxn1. 40

an indescribably sweet scent and the fruit resembles
a lupine, and is so prickly that no animal can touch it.
On a more elevated plateau in the same island there
are trees α that bear wool, but in a different manner to
those ὸ of the Chinese‚ as the leaves of these trees have
no growth on them, and might be thought to be vine-
leaves were it not that they are smaller3 but they
bear gourds of the size of a quince, which when they
ripen burst open and disclose balls of down from
which an expensive linen for clothing is made.
XXII. Their name for this tree is the gossypinus;
it also grows in greater abundance on the smaller
island of Tyros, which is ten miles distant from the
other. J uba says that this shrub has a woolly down
growing round it, the fabric made from which is
superior to the linen of India. He also says that
there is an Arabian tree called the cynas from which
cloth is made, which has foliage resembling a palm-
leaf. Similarly the natives of India are provided with
clothes by their own trees. But in the Tyros islands
there is also another tree with a blossom like a
white violet but four times as large; it has no scent,
which may well surprise us in that region of the
world.

XXIII. There is also another tree which resembles

this one but has more foliage and a rose—coloured 'ee'

blossom, which it closes at nightfall and begins to
open at sunrise, unfolding it fully at noon: the
natives speak of it as going to sleep. The same
island also produces palm-trees, olives and vines, as
well as figs and all the other kinds of fruit-trees.
None of the trees there sheds its leaves3 and the
island is watered by cold springs, and has a con—
siderable rainfall.
