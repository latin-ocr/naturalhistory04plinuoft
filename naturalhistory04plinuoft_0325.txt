g The 2(Targest fruit and the one that hangs highest
is that of pine-eones, which encloses inside it
small kernels lying in fretted beds and clothed in
another coat of rusty colour, showing the marvellous
care that Nature takes to provide seeds with a soft
place to lie in. A second class of pine-cones is that
of the Taranto pine, which has a shell that can be
broken in the fingers and which is rifled by the birds
while on the tree. A third kind is that of the
sappinia-cone which grows on the cultivated pitch-
pine, the kernels of which have such a soft husk, or
rather skin, that it is eaten with them. A fourth kind
is called pityis, growing on wild pines, which provides
an exceptionally good remedy against a cough when
the kernels are boiled in honey ; the people of Turin
call them raviceli.“ The winners in the games at the
Isthmus are crowned with a wreath of pine leaves.

X. The fruit. next to these in size is the one that
we call the quince and the Greeks cydoneum‚b which
was introduced from the island of Crete. This fruit
drags down the boughs in a curve and checks the
growth of the parent trec. There are several kinds
of quinces : the ‘ golden apple ' is clcft with incisions
and has a colour verging on gold, a brighter tinge
