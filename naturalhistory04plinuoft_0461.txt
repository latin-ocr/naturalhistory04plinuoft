observes throughout the year. First comes fertiliza-
tion, taking place when the west wind begins to blow,
which is generally from February the Sth. This

universe, its name Favonius being derived, as some
have supposed, from fovere, ‘ to foster.’ It blows
from due west and marks the beginning of spring.
Country people call it the cubbing season, as Nature
is longing to receive the seeds3 and when she brings
life to all the seeds sown‚ they conceive in a varying
number of days and each according to its nature,
some immediately, as is the case with animals,
while some do so more slowly and carry their progeny
for a longer period of gestation, and the process is
consequently called ‘ germination.’ When a plant
flowers it may be said to give birth, and the flower
