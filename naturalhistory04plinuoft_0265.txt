XVIII. Ι am not surprised therefore that many
centuries ago almost innumerable kinds of artificial
wine have becn invented, which we will now specify‚
all of them being used for medicinal purposes. In
an earlier volume we stated the method of making
omphacium, which is used for unguents. What is
called vine—flower wine is made from the claret vine,
that is the wild vine, by steeping two pounds of the
flowers of this plant in a jar of must3 30 days after-
wards they are changed. Beside this the root and
the grape-skins of the claret-vine are used in dressing
leather. These grape-skins‚ a little after the blossom
has gone off, provide a remarkable specific for cooling
attacks of feverish heat in cases of disease, being
said to be of an extremely cold nature. A portion
of these grapes die off from the heat before the
rest—these are called midsummer grapes3 the
whole of them never come to matursty, and if a
bunch in an unripe state before it completely withers
is fed to poultry it produces in them a distaste
for stealing grapes.

XIX. The first of the artificial wines, which is called
weak wine, is made from real wine in the following
manner: ten quarts of white must and half that
quantity of water are kept boiling till a considerable
amount of the water is boiled away. Other people
put in five quarts of sea-water and the same amount
of rain—water and leave the mixture in the sun for
40 days to evaporate. This drink is given to
invalids for whom it is feared that wine may be
harmful.
