it abounds, fire and water are not employed, but salt
is sprinkled on the pod and the oil is pressed out3
for food it is disgusting, and it is of thin quality for
burning in lampS. Amygdalinum, which some people
call neopum, is pressed out of bitter almonds, dried
and pounded into a cake that is sprinkled with water
and then pounded again. An oil is also made from
the bay-tree with an admixture of the oil of half—ripe
olives3 some people merely press the oil out of the
berries, others use only the leaves, and some the leaf
and the outer skin of the berries, and also add styrax
gum and other scents. The best kind of hay-trec
for this is the broad-leaved wild laurel with black
berries. A similar oil also comes from the black
myrtle, and the broad-leaved variety of this is the
best. The berries are sprinkled with hot water and
pounded, and then boiled down. Other people boil
down the softest of the leaves in oil and press out the
liquid, and others steep them in oil and allow them
to mature in the sun before putting them in the press.
The same method is also used in the case of the
cultivated myrtle, but the wild variety with a smaller
pod is preferred, the kind which certain people call
oxymyrsine, others ground—myrsine, and some
acoruma because of its resemblance to that plant,
as it grows low and bushy.

Oil is also made from the citrus and the cypress, Other trees
from walnuts-this is called caryinum‚b from apples angdlssffrm
and from the cedar called pisselaeon 3⁶ also from grain maffia? ‘'²'‘-
of Cnidusd by cleaning and pounding the seed, and
likewise from mastich. As for the method of making
cypros-oil and also oil from an Egyptian berry for
the purpose of scents, we have spoken of it already. X11.100.
