BOOK XIV. 111. 15—18

merely white and black are the common sorts. But
the large-clusterss grapes swell out like a breast
and the finger-grapes have an exceptionally long
berry. Also such is the sportiveness of nature that
very large grapes have small grapes clinging to
them as companions which rival them in sweetness:
these are called in Greek ‘ small-berry ' vines.
Some grapes will last all through the winter if the
clusters are hung by a string from the ceiling‚ and
others will keep merely in their own natural vigour
by being stood in earthenware jars with casks put
over them, and packed round with fermenting
grape—skins; others can be given a flavour by
smoke, which also adds flavour to wines‚ and the
authority of Tiberius Caesar has caused particular
glory in regard to the efficiency of smoke in this
respect to attach to the forges of Africa3 before his
time priority at the table belonged to the Raetic
grapes from the territory of Verona. Moreover,
raisins are called ‘ passi ’ ὁ from having ‘ endured ' the
sun. Grapes are also preserved in must, and so made
drunk with their own wine, and some are made
sweeter by being placed in must that has been boiled
down3 but others remain on the parent vine to await
the coming of a new generation, acquiring a glassy
transparency‚ and the astringency of pitch poured
on the footstalk gives them the same durable hard-
ness that it gives to wine in casks or jars. A vine has
now been discovered that of itself produces a flav our
of pitch in the wine: this vine gives celebrity to
the territory of Vienne by the varieties of Monte
Taburno and of the Sotani and Helvii3 it has become
famous only recently and was unknown 1n the period

of the poet Virgil, who died 90 years ago. Add that
