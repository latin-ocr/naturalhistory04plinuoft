present day we ascend to the roof of the temple of
Diana at Ephesus by a staircase made from a single
vine, grown it is said at Cyprus, inasmuch as vines
grow to an exceptional height in that island. And
no other timber lasts for longer ages.

But I am inclined to believe that the things rnen-

Our own vines are kept down by yearly pruning, and
all their strength is drawn out into shoots‚ or else
thrown downward into layers, and the only benefit
these supply is that of their juice‚ obtained by means
of a variety of methods adapted to the peculiarities
of the climate and the qualities of the soil. In
Campania the vines espouse the poplars‚ and embrac-
ing their brides and climbing with wanton arms in a
series of knots among their branches, rise level with
their tops, soaring alost to such a height that a hired
vintager expressly stipulates in his contract for the
cost of a funeral and a grave 1 In fact they never stop

houses and mansions encircled by the shoots and
clinging tendrils of a single vine. And a thing that

also by Valerianus Cornelius is that a single vine in
the colonnades of Livia at Rome protects the open
walks with its shady trellises, while at the same time
it produces 12 amphorae of jujce yearly.

Elms indeed are everywhere overtopped by vines,
and there is a story that Cineas, the ambassador of
King Pyrrhus, was surprised at the height to which
the vines grew at La Riccia and made an amusing
