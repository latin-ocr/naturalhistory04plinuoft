denarii a pound. It is reported that scented rush is
also found in Campania.

We have now left the countries looking on the ocean
to come to those that converge towards our seas.
XLIX. Well‚ Africa, which lies below Ethiopia, in
its sandy deserts distils tear-like drops of a sub-
stance called hammoniacum3 this is also the origin
of the name of the Oracle of Hammon, near to which
this substance is produced from a tree called
metopon, after the manner of resin or gum. There
are two kinds of hammoniacum ε one called thrauston
(friable)‚ which is like male frankincense and is the
kind most approved, and the other, greasy and resi-
nous, which they call phyrama (paste). It is adulter-
ated with sand, which looks as isit has stuck to it while
growing; consequently it is preferred in extremely
small lumps and these as pure as possible. The price
of the best hammoniacum is 40 asses a pound.

L. The sphagnos valu ed most highly is found in the
province of Cyrenaica, south of these regions: others
call it bryon. The second place is held by the Cyprian
kind, and the third by the Phoenician. It is also
said to grow in Egypt, and indeed in Gaul as well,
and I am not prepared to doubt this; for there are
grey tufts that bear this name growing on trees,
resembling the growths that we principally see on the
oak, but having a ‘superior scent. The most highly
esteemed are the whitest and most widely spreading
mosses, and the bright red ones are in the second
class, but no value at all is attached to the black
variety; moreover, the mosses that grow on islands
and on rocks are not esteemed, nor are all those that
have the scent of palm-trees and not that of their
own kind.
