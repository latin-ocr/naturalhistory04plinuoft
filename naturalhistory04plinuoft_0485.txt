olive and apple and cypresses spread their roots
through the top layer of the turs, in some cases
shooting straight out, as with the laurel and olive,
and in other cases winding about, as with the fig.
This tree bristles with fine filaments, as also do the
fu- and a number of forest trees, from which the
mountain people pluck extremely thin threads and
plait them into handsome flasks and other vessels.
Some people have stated that the roots of trees do
not go down deeper than the warmth of the sun’s
heat can reach, and this according to the nature of
the soil, whether rather thin or heavy3 but Ι think
that this is incorrect, as it is certainly found in the
authorities that when a fir-tree was transplanted it
measured four yards in depth, though it had not been
dug up whole but had been broken off. The root
of the citrus-wood tree is the largest in extent and
abundance‚ and next to it those ofthe plane, the hard-
oak and the acorn-bearing trees. Some trees have a
root that is more tenacious of life than the part
above ground, for instance the laurel; and accord-
ingly, when it has withered in the trunk, if it is cut
back it shoots again even more vigorously. Some
people think that trees grow old more quickly owing
to naving short roots, but this is disproved by fig-
trees‚ which have very long roots and grow old very
quickly. I also consider false a statement that has
been made by some persons, to the effect that the
roots of trees become smaller with age, for an aged
oak when overturned by a violent storm has been
seen to embrace a Roman acre of ground.

often to be replaced and to come back to life again
owing to the earth forming a sort of scab over the
