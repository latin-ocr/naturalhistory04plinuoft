similaily occurs in the black xaliety. Also one kind
has a black seed and another a seed of the colour of
saffron; the latte1 ixy is used by poets for their
wrcaths, and its leaves arc not so dark in colour;
some people call it Nysian ivy and others Bacchic
ivy, and it has the largest clusters of all the blac-k
ivies. Some people among the Greeks also make two
classes of this variety, depending on the colour of the
berries—red-berry ivy and golden-fruit ivy.

But it is the helix which has most varieties of all,
as it differs very greatly in leaf. The leaves are small
and angular and osa rather elegant shape‚ whereas
those of the remaining kinds are plain and simple.
It differs also in the distance between the joints,
but particularly in its infertility, as it does not bear
any fruit. Some people think that this is a matter
of age and not of kind, and that the plant begins
as a helix and becomes an ivy when it gets old.
This is seen to be a clear mistake on their part,
inasmuch as we find several more kinds of helix, but
three that are most noticeable——the grass-green helix
which is the commonest, a second kind with a white
leaf, and a third kind with a variegated leaf, which is
called Thracian ivy. Moreover there is a grass-ivy
with rather narrow and symmetrically arranged and
rather thickly growing leaves, and in another variety
all these points are different3 also in the variegated
ivy one variety has narrower leaves arranged in a
similar way and clustering more thickly, and another
variety entirely lacking these features, and also the
leaves are either larger or smaller, and differ in the
arrangement of their markings3 and in the white
ivy in some cases the leaves are whiter than in others.
The grass-green ivy grows the longest shoots; but
