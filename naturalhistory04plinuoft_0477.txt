BOOK XVI. L. 116-L1. 119

older they grow, and bear earlier in sunny places and
on a thin soil; all wild trees are later, some of them
never ripening their fruit at all. Similarly trees that
have the earth underneath them ploughed or
broken up ripen their fruit quicker than ones that
are not attended to, · those so treated also bear
larger crops.

LI. Moreov er there is another difference, connected Va erietir:
w ith age. Almond- trees and pears have the largest0² o‘sffr‘C

crops in their old age, as also do the acorn- bearing
trees and one kind of fig, but all the other fruit-
trees u hen young and when ripening more slowly3
and this is especially noticeable in the case of vines,
for the older vines make better wine and the young
ones give a laiger quantity. The apple however
grows old very quickly and in its old age bears in-
ferior fruit, as the apples it produces are smaller
and liable to be worm-eaten, the worms being also
generated on the tree itself. The fig is the only
one of all the trees grown that is given a drug ‘² to
assist its ripening——truly a portentous thing, that
greater prices are paid for fruit out of season!
But all fruit-trees that bear their fruit before the
proper time grow old prematurely3 indeed some die
at once when the weather has lured them to surrendcr
their whole stock of fertility, a thing that happens
most of all to vines. The mulberry‚ on the other
hand, grows old very slowly, being very little ex-
hausted by its crop; and also the trees whose timber
has wrinkled markings age slowly‚ for instance the
palm, the maple and the poplar. Also trees grow
old more quickly when the earth under them is
ploughed, whereas forest trees age very slowly.
Consequently trees carefully tended blossom earlier
