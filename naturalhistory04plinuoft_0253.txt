hepsema and in our country sapa, is a product of art,
not of nature, made by boiling down must to a third

vised for adulterating with honey; but the wines
previously mentioned are the product of the grape
and of the soil. Next after the raisin-wine of Crete
those of Cilicia and of Africa are held in esteem.
Raisin-wine is known to be made in Italy and in the
neighbouring provinces from the grape called by the
Greeks psithia and by us ‘ muscatel‚' α and also
scripula, the grapes being left on the vine longer
than usual to ripen in the sun, or else being ripened
in boiling oil. Some people make this wine from any
sweet white grape that ripens early, drying them in
the sun till little more than halftheir weight remains‚
and then they beat them and gently press out the
juice. Afterwards they add to the skins the same
quantity of well-water as they have pressed out juice,
so as also to make raisin-wine of second quality. The
more careful makers, after drying the bunches in the
stunc manner, pick off the berries and soak them
without their stalks in wine of good quality till they
swell, and then press them—and this kind of wine is
the most highly praised of any ; and then they repeat
the process, adding more water, and make a wine of
second quality.

Between the sirops and real wine is the liquor that Muss-
the Greeks call aigleucos—this is our ‘ permanent
must.' Care is needed for its production, as it must
