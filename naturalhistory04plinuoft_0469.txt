use, although the timber of the male tree is one of the
strongest and hardest there is, so great is the differ-
ence caused by sex in the same kind of tree. The
terebinth and also the maple and the ash produce
their seed at harvest time, but nut-trees, apples and
pears, excepting winter or early varieties‚ in the
autumn, and the acorn-bearing trees still later, at
the setting of the Pleiades, the winter oak only in
autumn, while some kinds of apple and pear and the
cork-tree fruit at the beginning of winter. The
