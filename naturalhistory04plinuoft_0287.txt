its windows ought to face north—east, or at all events
east ; dunghills and tree-roots must be a long way off,
and all objects with a strong smell should be avoided,
as it very easily passes into wine—particularly there
must be no fig-trees or wild figs near; also spaces
must be left between the jars, to prevent taints
passing from one to the other, as wine is always liable
to very rapid infection. Moreover (these instruc-
tions proceed) the shape of the jars is important:
pot-bellied and broad ones are not so good. Imme-

sea-water or water with salt in it, and then sprinkled
with ashes of brushwood or else with potter's earth,
and then rubbed clean and fumigated with myrrh, as
should frequently be done with the wine-cellars also.
NVeak vintages should be kept in jars sunk in the
ground, but jars containing strong wines should be
exposed to the air. The jars must never be filled
quite full, and the space above the surface of the
wine must be smeared with raisin-wine or boiled-
down must mixed with saffron or iris pounded
up with boiled must. The lids of the jars should
be treated in the same way, with the addition of
mastich or Bruttian piteh. It is laid down that
jars must not be opened at mid-winter except on a
fine day, and not when a south wind is blowing, or
at a full moon.

warm to the touch, or if the lids sweat. Wine that
quickly begins to form a flower and to develop an
odour is not going to keep. Also boiled-down must
