bitter and dry to the taste. Omphacium 36113 at 6
denarii a pound. There is also another way of
making it, by pounding up unripe grapes in mortars;
the grapes are afterwards dried in the sun and
divided up into lozenges.

LXI. To the same family also belongs bryon,⁰ ob-
tained from the catkins of the white poplar. The
best kind grows in the neighbourhood of Cnidus or
Caria, in waterless districts or on dry rough ground,
and a second best quality grows on the cedar in
Lycia. To the same group also belongs oenanthe,
obtained from the cluster of the wild vine. It is
picked when it flowers, which is the time when it
has the best scent, and it is dried in the shade on
a linen sheet spread out for the purpose, and then
put into casks to store. The best kind comes
from Parapotamia, the second best from Antiochia
and Laodicea in Syria, and the third best from
the mountains in Media; the last kind is more
useful for medicines. Some people prefer the kind
that grows in the island of Cyprus to all of these. As
for the oenanthe produced in Africa it is only used
by the doctors‚ and is called massaris. But all the
oenanthe obtained from the white wild vine is
superior to that from the black.

LXII. There is also another tree that likewise
serves for producing unguents, which is called by
some people an elate—the Latin for which is ‘ fir '
—and by others a palm and by others again a spatha.
That of Hammonium is most highly spoken of, next
the Egyptian variety, and then the Scythian. lt only
has a scent if it grows in regions devoid of water;
it has tears of a greasy consistency, which are added
to unguents to overcome the hardness of the oil.
