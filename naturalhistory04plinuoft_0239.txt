VIII. Who can doubt, however, that some kinds
of wine are more agreeable than others, or who
does not know that one of two wines from the same
vat can be superior to the other, surpassing its
relation either owing to its cask or from some acci-
dental circumstance? And consequently each man
will appoint himself J udge of the question which wine
heads the list. Julia Augusta gave the credit for her
eighty-six years of life to the wine of Pizzino, having
never drunk any other. It is grown on a bay of the
Adriatic not far from the source of the Timavus, on a
rocky hill, where the breeze off the sea ripens enough
grapes to make a few casks; and no other wine is
considered more suitable for medicinal purposes. I
am inclined to believe that this is the wine from the
Adriatic Gulf which the Greeks have extolled with
such marvellous encomiums under the name of
Praetutian. His late Majesty Augustus preferred
Setinum to all wines whatsoever, and so for the most
part did the Emperors who came after him, owing to
the verdict of experience that because injurious
attacks of indigestion do not readily arise from this
liquor. . . . It grows just above Foro Appio. Pre-
viously Caecuban wine had the reputation of being
the most generous of all ; it was grown in some poplar
woods on marshy ground on the Bay of Amyclae,
but the vineyard has now disappeared owing to the
neglect of the cultivator and the confined area of
the ground, though in a greater degree owing to
the ship canal from the lake of Baiae to Ostia that
was begun by Nero.

The second rank belonged to the Falernian district,
and in it particularly to the estate of Faustusa in
consequence of the care taken in its cultivation ; but
