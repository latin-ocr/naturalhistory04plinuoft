sweet3 also there is a difference in the shortness or

length of the stalk.

In respect of the trees themselves the one that Variniesas
bears the largest acorn is called the hemeris 3⁰ this ζζῖῗῑξῗὺζζ
is a comparativcly low-growing oak which forms a
circle of bushy foliage and which is frequently hollow
at the spread of the branches.⁶ The wood of
the common oak is stronger and less liable to decay;
this variety also has many branches, but grows higher
and has a thicker trunk3 but the loftiest kind is the
aegilops,⁶ which likes wild uncultivated country.

Next to this in height is the broad-leaved oak, but
it is less useful for builders' timber and for charcoal,
and when hewn with the axe is liable to split, on
which account it is used in the unhewn state. As
charcoal it only pays to use it in a copper-smith’s
workshop‚ because as soon as the bellows stop it dies
down and has to be rekindled repeatedly3 but it
gives out a great quantity of sparks. A better
charcoal is obtained from young trees. Piles of
freshly cut sticks are fitted closely together and made
into an oven with clay, and the structure is set fire
to, and the shell as it hardens is prodded with poles
and so discharges its moisture.

The worst kind both for charcoal and for timber is
the one called in Greek the ‘sea—cork ' oak, which
has a very thick bark and trunk, the latter usually
hollow and spongy3 and no other variety of the oak
class is so liable to rot, even while it is alive. More-
over it is very frequently struck by lightning,
although it is not particularly lofty3 consequently
it is not thought right to use its wood for sacrifices
either. Also it rarely bears acorns, and when it does
they are bitter, so that no animal will touch them
