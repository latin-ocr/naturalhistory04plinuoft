ceptible taste or flavour is a defect. In all these
flavours smell is of great importance and a great
factor of affi11ity3 in the 6356 of water even smell
is entirely absent, or if perceptible at all is a defect.
It is a remarkable fact that the three chief natural
elements, water, air and fire, have neither 13516,
5111611, nor any flavour whatever.

XXXIII. Among juices, then,those with a vinous Colour ana
flavour are the juices of the pear, the mulberry and jffissssg‘fssrm'
the myrtle—berry, and surprising as it may seem, the
juice of the grape least of all. The juiee of the olive,
laurel, walnut and almond is unctuous, that of grapes,
figs and dates is 511661, and 11131 of plums watery.
There 15 3150 3 great difference in the 6010111· ofjuice ε
11131 of the mulberry‚ the cherry, the cornel and
the black grape is blood—red; the juice of white
grapes is of a light 6010111·; fig juice is milky white
in the part near the stall< but not in 1116 body of
the fruit3 apple juice 15 1116 6010111· of foam3
peach juice has no colour at all, in spite of 1116
fact that the hard peaeh 1135 3 large quantity of
juice, but no one would say that this has any
colour.

Smell also contains 115 own marvels. Apples have
a pungent scent, peaches a weak one, and 511661
fruits none 31 311; for even 511661 111116 1135 110 5111611,
although thin wine 1135 111016 aroma, and 1111165 of that
61355 become fit for use much sooner than those with
more body. Fruits with 3 566111 are not likewise
agreeable to the palate, as scent and flavour do not go
together—so that citrons have a very penetrating
smell and a very rough 13516, and in some degree
that is the 6356 with quinces also; and flgs have
no smell.
