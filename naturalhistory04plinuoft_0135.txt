Crete, but even more in Sicily. Palmwood makes
charcoal that lasts a long time and burns slowly. In
the palms that bear fruit the core of the fruit is
shorter in some cases than in others and also softer3

and in others in thickness. Consequently there are
forty-nine kinds of palm, if one cared to go through

foreign names, and the varieties of wine that are
extracted from them. The most famous of all is
honoured by the name of the royal palm, because it
used to be reserved for the kings of Persia alone;
it grew only at Babylon in the Garden of Bagoi‘is—
the Persian word for a eunuch, some of these having
actually been kings in Persia. This garden was
always kept within the precincts of the ruler's court.

come to us about this tree, to the effect that it dies
off and then comes to life again of itself—a peculiarity
which it shares with the phoenix‚‘³ which is thought to
have taken its name from the suggestion of this palm-
tree: the tree was bearing fruit at the time when
