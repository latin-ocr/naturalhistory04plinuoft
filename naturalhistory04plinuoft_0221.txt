valuable property, if indeed it is true that there is
any vine that is exempt from the power of the
climate.

The spionia, called by some the thorn-vine, is able to
bear heat, and is ripened by rainy weather in autumn ;
what is more, indeed, it is the only vine that thrives
from sog, on which account it is specially grown in the
district t’of Ravenna. The venicula is one of the best
vines that shed their flowers, and its grapes are par-
ticularly well suited for preserving in jars3 the people
of Campania prefer to call it by the name of surcula,
and others by that of scapula, while the name for it
at Tarracina is Numisiana3 it has no strength of its
own but 15 entirely conditioned by the strength of 1116

For at Vesuvius there is Murgentina, a very strong
vine imported from Sicily, called by some Pompeiana,
which only bears well in a rich soil, just as 1116 horconia
vine only flourishes in Campania. The opposite is
the case with the arceraca, called in Virgila argitis,
which has the property of imparting extra richness to
the soil, while itself offering 3 very stout resistance to
rain and to old age, though it will hardly produce
wine every year, and its grapes are only valued for
eating, but it bears exceptionally large crops. The
mettica vine also stands the years, and faces all
weather very strongly; it bears a black grape, and
its 1111165 acquire a reddish colour 111 old age.
