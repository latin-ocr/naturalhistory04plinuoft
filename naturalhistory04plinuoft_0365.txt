lately heard a man of consular rank declare that he
owned 301116 walnut trees that actually bore two
crops a year. We have already spoken in the
proper place of the pistachio, which 1s also a sort o
nut. This also w as likewise first brought into Italy by
V itellius at the same time, and it w as simultaneously
introduced into Spain by Pompeius Flaccus, Knight
of Rome, who was serving with Vitellius.

XXV. We give the name of nut to the chestnut
also, although it seems to fit better into the acorn
class. The chestnut has its armed rampart in its
bristling shell, which in the acorn is only partly
developed, and it is surprising that what nature has
taken such pains to conceal should be the least valu-
able of things. Some chestnuts produce three nuts
from one shell; and the skin is tough‚ but next to the
body of the nut there is a membrane which both in
the chestnut and the walnut spoils the taste if it 13
1101 peeled off. It is more agreeable as a food when
roasted, provided it is ground up, and it supplies a
sort of imitation bread for women when they are
keeping a fast. They came first from Sardis, and
consequently they are called nuts of Sardis among
the Greeks, for the name of Zeus’s nut was given
them later, after they had been improved by cultiva—
tion. There are now several varieties of them. The
Taranto chestnut is light and digestible to eat3 it
1133 3 flat shape‚ The chestnut called the acorn-
chestnut is rounder; it is very easy to peel, and
jumps out of the shell quite clean of its own accord.
The Salarian chestnut also has a flat shape‚ but that
of Taranto is less easy to handle. The Corellian is
more highly spoken of, and so is the variety produced
from it by the method which we shall speak of in

Pistachio.
