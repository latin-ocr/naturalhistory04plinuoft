shown by its very name to be an exotic even in A’sia
Minor and in Greece, and to have been introduced
from Persia. But the wild plum is known to grow
everywhere, which makes it more surprising that
this fruit 1s not mentioned by Cato, especially as he
pointed out the way of storing some wild fruits also.
As for the peach· -tree, it was only introduced lately,
and that with difficulty, inasmuch as in Rhodes, which
was its first place of sojourn after leaving Egypt, it
does not bear at all. It is not true that the peach
grown in Persia is poisonous and causes torturing
pain, and that, when it had been transplanted into
Egypt by the kings to use as a punishment, the nature
of the soil caused it to lose its dangerous properties 3
for the more careful writers relate this of the persea,“
which is an entirely different tree, resembling the
red myxa, and which has refused to grow anywhere
but in the east. The sebesten also, according to the
more learned authorities, was not introduced from
Persia for punitive purposes, but was planted at
Memphis by Perseus, and it was for that reason that
Alexander, in order to do honour to his ancestor,
established the custom of using wreaths of it for
crowning victors in the games ὁ at Memphis. It
always has leaves and fruit upon it, fresh ones sprout-
ing immediately after the others. But it will be
obvious that all our plums also have been introduced
since the time of Cato.
