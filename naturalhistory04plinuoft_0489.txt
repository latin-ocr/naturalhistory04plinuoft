manifold and lnarvcllous mcthods. 111 fact, we have
shown that not all trees will grow in all places, or
live if removed from one place to another3 this is
due in some cases to antipathy, in others to obstinacy,
more frequently to the weakness of the specimens
transplanted‚ because in some cases the climate is
unfavourable and in others the soil is incompatible.
LIX. Balm of Gilead disdains to grow elsewhere‚‘²
and a citron grown in Assyria will not bear else-
where ; and likewise the palm also will not grow every-
where or, even if it does grow, bear fruit, or else even
when it has made a promise and a show of bearing,
refuses to mature the fruit, seeming to have given birth
to it against its will. The cinnamon shrub has not
the strength to travel to the neighbourhood of Syria.
The delicate perfumes of amomum and nard cannot
endure to travel out of India and be conveyed by sea
even as far as Arabia—an attempt to import them
was made by King Seleucus. What is most surprising
is that although the trees themselves can usually be
persuaded to live and to bear transplantation, and
occasionally even the soil will grant the request to
nourish foreigners and give food to immigrants,
the climate is absolutely unrelcnting. The pepper-
tree will live in Italy, and the casia-plant even in a
northern region, and the incense-tree has been
known to live in Lydia, but where are we to get the
sunshine that sucks all the juice out of these plants
or ripens the drops of essence that they shed?
It is nearly as surprising that Nature may alter in
the same localities and yet retain a hundred per
centb of her vigour. She had bestowed the cedar
on the regions of torrid heat, but it grows in the
mountains of Lycia and Phrygia. She had made cold
