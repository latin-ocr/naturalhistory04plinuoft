favour, while its actual timber lasts for ever, and
consequently it has been the regular practice to use
it even for making statues of the gods—the Apollo
Sosianus in a shrine at Rome, which was broughta
from Seleucia, is made of cedar-wood. There is a
tree resembling 'che cedar in Arcadia, and a shrub in
Phrygia is called the cedrys.

XII. Syria also has the turpentine-tree. Of this
the male variety has no fruit, but the female has two
kinds of fruit, one of them ruddy and the size of a
lentil, while the other is pale, and ripens at the same
time as the grape3 it is no larger in size than a bean,
has a rather agreeable scent, and is sticky to the
touch. Round Mount Ida in the Troad and in Mace-
donia this is a low-growing shrub-like tree, but at
Damascus in Syria it is big. Its wood is fairly flexible
and remains sound to a great age3 it is of a shiny
black colour. The flower grows in clusters like the
olive, bu'c is crimson in colour, and the foliage is thick.
It also bears follicles out of which come insects resem-

bling gnats, and which produce a sticky resinous fluid
which also bursts out from its bark. XIII. Also the

male sumach-tree of Syria is productive, the female ⁸²¹ ’Μ

being barren; the leaf is that of an elm only a little
longer, covered with down, and the footstalks of the
leaves always lying alternately in opposite directions 3
the branches are slender and short. The sumach is
used for bleaching leather. The seed, which re·
sembles a lentil, turns red at the same time as the
grapes3 it is called rhus and is required for certain
dru s.

XgIV. Egypt also has many kinds of trees not found
anywhere else, before all a fig, which is consequently
called the Egyptian fig. The tree resembles a mul-
