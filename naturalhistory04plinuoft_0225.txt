frost. Pisa rejoices in the vine of Paros, and Modena

in the vine of Perugia‚ which has a black grape and

makes a wine that within four years turns white. It

is a remarkable fact that at Modena there is a grape

that turns round with the sun and is consequently

called in Greek the ‘ revolving grape '3 and that in

Italy a grape from Gaul is popular, but across the

Alps that of Picenum. Virgil mentions a Thasian Georoics ΙΙ·
vine, a Maraeotid and a Lageam and a number of91'
other foreign kinds that are not found in Italy.

But again there are some vines which are dis· Vinesqrown

instance, among the hard-berry group the ambrosia
grape, which needs no jars but will keep on the
vine, so strong is its resistance to cold and heat and
to bad weather, nor does it require a tree or stakes
to support it, as it sustains its own weight‚ though
this is not the case with the dactylis, the stalk of
which is only the thickness of a finger3 and among
the vines with large bunches the pigeon—vine‚ and
still more the purple ‘ double—bosomed ' vine, so
called because it does not bear clusters but only
secondary bunches; and also the ‘ three-foot ' vine,
named from its size, and also the ‘ rush ’ vine with its
shrivelled grape and the vine called the Raetic vine
in the Maritime Alps, which is quite unlike the famous
vine of that name, because this is a short-stalked vine
with closely packed clusters and producing a low class
oswine ; but it has the thinnest skin of any grape, and
a single very small stone (called chium), and one or two
grapes in each bunch are exceptionally large. There
is also the black Aminean grape to which they give
the name of ‘ Syrian grape,' and also the Spanish grape,
which is the most highly rated of the inferior kinds.
