founders of the city 200 years before the fall of Troy ;
it is kept inside the town itself———Hannibal from
motives of religion spared it—and its beamS‚ made
of juniper‚ are still in existence even now.
Memorable above all is the temple of the same
goddess at Aulis, built some centuries before the
Trojan war; all knowledge of what kind of timber
it was built of has entirely disappeared. Broadly
speaking it ean at all events be said that those woods
have the most outstanding durability which have the
most agreeable seent. Next in esteem after the
timbers mentioned stands that of the mulberry,
which even darkens with age. At the same time also
some woods last longer when employed in certain
ways than they do otherwise: elm lasts best ex-
posed to the air, hard oak when used under ground,
and oak when submerged under water—oak when
above the ground warps and makes craeks in strue-
tures. Larch and blaek alder do the best in damp3
hard oak is rotted by sea water. Beech and walnut
are also well spoken of for use in water, these timbers
indeed holding quite the first place among those that
are used under the ground, and likewise juniper
(which is also very serviceable for struetures exposed
to the air), whereas beech and Turkey oak quickly

The alder on the other hand if driven into the ground
in marshy places lasts for ever and stands a load of any
amount. Cherry is a strong wood, elm and ash are

is reported to be liable to wood-worm when used in
