but the abortive fruit that does not mature forms
after the leaves have grown. The fig-trec also pro-
duces an early crop of fruit, called at Athens ⁴ fore-
runners,' especially in the Spartan variety.

In the same class of fruit-trees there arc some
that bear two crops, (L.) and on the island of Cos the
wild figs bear three, the first eliciting a following
crop and the following crop a third one. It is this
last crop that is used in the process of caprification.

But in the wild fig also the fruit grows at the back of

the leaves. Among the apples and the pears there
are some that bear two crops a year, as also there
are some early varieties. The wild apple bears twice,
its second crop coming after the rising of Arcturus,
especially in sunny localities. There are indeed
vines that actually bear three crops, which con-
sequently people call ‘ mad vines,’ because on these
some grapes are ripening while others are just
beginning to swell and other bunches are only in
flower. Marcus Varro states that there once was a
vine at the temple of the Mother of the Gods in
Smyrna that bore three times a year, and an apple
tree in the district of Cosenza that did the same.
But this regularly occurs in the district of Tacupe
in Africa (about which we shall say more in another
place), such is the fertility of the soil. The cypress
also bears three times, for its berries are gathered in
January, May and September, and those of each
crop are of a different size.

But also in the trees themselves, even when laden
with fruit, there is a difference between different
kinds: the arbutus and the oak bear more fruit in
their upper part and the walnut and the marisca fig
on their lower branches. All trees bear earlier the
