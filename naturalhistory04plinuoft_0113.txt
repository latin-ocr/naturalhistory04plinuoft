and in others from other causes3 and the first thing
proper to know about them is that their importance
changes, quite often their fame having passed away.
The perfume most highly praised in the old days was
made on the island of Delos, but later that from the
Egyptian town of Mendes ranked the highest. Nor
was this only the result of the blending and combi-
nation of several scents, but the same juices gained
supremacy or degenerated in various ways in differ-

highly, but subsequently that of Rhodes3 vine-
flower scent made in Cyprus was preferred, but after-

joram made in Cos, but afterwards quince-blossom
unguent from the same place, and cyprus—scent made
in CypruS, but subsequently that made in Egypt3
at this point scent from Mendes and almond-oil
