XXXVII. Arabia also still boasts of her ladanum.a Gum-
A considerable number of writers have stated that '‘mamm“
this becomes aromatic entirely by accident and
owing to an injury3 goats, they say, an animal very
destructive of foliage in general, but especially fond
of scented shrubs, as if understanding the prices they
fetch‚ crop the stalks of the shoots, which swell with
an extremely sweet fluid, and wipe off with the
nasty shaggy hair of their beards the jujce dropping
from the stalks in a random mixture, and this
forms lumps in the dust and is baked by the sun3
and that is the reason why goats' hairs are found in
ladanum3 though they say that this does not take
place anywhere else but in the territory of the
Nabataei, a people from Arabia who border on Syria.
The more recent of the authorities call this substance
⁴ storbon,’ and say that the trees in the Arabs'
forests are broken by the goats when browsing, and
so the juice sticks to their hairs3 but that the true
ladanum belongs to the island of Cyprus—to mention
the various kinds of scents incidentally even though
not in the order of their localities of provenance.
It is reported that the same thing takes place there
too, and that there is a substance called oesypum
which sticks to the beards and shaggy knees of the
goats, but that it is produced by their nibbling down
the flower of the ivy while they are browsing in the
morning, when Cyprus is wet with dew3 and that
subsequently when the sun has driven away the
mist the dust clings to their damp fleeces and thus
ladanum can be combed out of them.

Some people call the plant in Cyprus from which Ιιοεςιῑ,
ladanum is produced ‘ leda,' as in fact these οεΠΞξῇἷζΐᾲοῙ
