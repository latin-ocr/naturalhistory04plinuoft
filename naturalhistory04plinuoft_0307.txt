increase until the rising of the Rem-ward, that is till
September 163 afterwards the increase is in the size
of the stones and the flesh. At this stage if rain
follows in actually large quantities‚ the oil is spoiled
and turns into leeS. The colour of these lces makes
the olive—oil turn black, and consequently when there
is only a tinge of black beginning it contains very
little lees, and before any blackness shows none at
all. People are quite mistaken in supposing what is
really the near approach ofdecay to be the beginning
of ripening, aud it is also a mistake to imagine that
the amount of oil is increased by the growth of the
flesh of the olive, since all the juice is then going into
a solid form and the woody interior is getting bigger.
It is on this account that olive-trees are watered
most plentifully at this period, but watering, whether
done intentionally or occurring from repeated falls
of rain, uses up the oil, unless fine weather follows ’to
diminish the solid part of the berry. For, as Theo-
phrastus holds, the cause of oil as of other things is
entirely warmth‚ and this is why steps are taken to
produce warmth even in the presses and the cellars
by lighting large fires. A third mistake is in over-
econOmy, as owing to the eost of picking people wait
for the olives to fall. Those who compromise on a
middle course in this matter knock the fruit down
with poles, so injuring the trees and causing loss in
the following year ; in fact there was a very old regu-
lation for the olive harvest ε ‘ Neither strip nor beat
an olive-tree.’ Those who proceed most carefully use
a reed and strike the branches with a light sideway
blow; but even this method causes the tree to pro-
duce fruit only every other year, as the buds get
knocked off, and this is no less the case if people
