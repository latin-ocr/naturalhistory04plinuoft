branching is nearly vertical and the boughs project
upward towards the sky, and do not slope down
sideways. It is a remarkable thing that this tree
dies if the tops of the branches are lopped, but survives
if they are cut off entirely from the trunk 3 also should
the trunk be cut off below where the branches were,
what remains lives, whereas if only the top be re-
moved the whole tree dies. Some trees branch out
from the root up, like the elm, others throw out boughs
only at the top, like the pine and the Greek bean-
tree, which at Rome they call the lotus ‘¹ because of
the sweetness of its fruit, which although growing
wild almost resembles cherries. The exuberance of
its branches makes it specially in request for houses,
as they grow on a short main stem and spread out
with a very wide expanse of shade‚ often leaping
across to the neighbouring mansions. No shady
foliage is more short-lived‚ and the branches do not
take away the sun, their leaves falling in winter.
No trees have bark that is more agreeable or attrac-
tive to look at, and none have branches that are
longer and stouter or more numerous, so that they
might be described as being themselves so many
trees. Their bark serves for staining hides and their
root for dyeing wool. Apple trees have branches of
a peculiar kind, resembling the muzzles of wild
animals, several smaller boughs being attached to one
very large one.
