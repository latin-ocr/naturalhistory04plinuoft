XXXVI. An exceptionally remarkable thing occurs Peculp'ar1'e2·cs
in the case of the elm, lime, olive, white poplar and ⁰ss⁰lu¹⁹⁶'
willow: aster midsummer their leaves turn right
round, and no other indication shows with greater
certainty that the season is finished. Also their leaves
contain in themselves a variation that is common to
all foliage: the under surface, towards the ground,
is of a bright grass—green colour, and on the same side
they are comparatively smooth, while on their upper
part they have sinews and hard skin and articulations‚
but creases underneath like the human hand. The
leaves of the olive are whiter and not so smooth on
the upper side, and ivy-leaves the same. But the
leaves of all trees open out every day towards the
sun, as if intending their under side to be warmed.

The upper side of all leaves has however small an
amount of down upon it, which in some countries
serves for wool.

XXXVII. We have said that in the east palm· Palm-leores
leaves are used for making strong ropes, and that ζξζιζῗξξ
these are made specially serviceable for use in X11l·30·
water. Indeed with us also the leaves are plucked
from the palms after harvest, the better ones being
those that have no divisions in them, and are put to
dry indoors for a period of four days and then spread
out in the sun, being left out at night as well, until
they dry a bright white colour, and afterwards they
are split for use in manufacture.

XXXVIII. ΤῙιθ fig, vine and plane have very broad Various
leaves and the myrtle, pomegranate and olive narrow {fficssfffnye
ones ; those of the pine and cedar are like hairs, those ἔξω* ⁰s
of the holly and one kind of holm-oak priokly—indeed aves.
the juniper has a spine instead ofa leaf. The leaves

of the cypress and tamarisk are fleshy, those of the
