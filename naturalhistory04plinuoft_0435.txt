it is used for embalming the bodies of the dead.
XXII. The liquor that follows is thicker, and now
produces pitch3 this in its turn is collected in copper
cauldrons and thickened by means of vinegar, as
making it coagulate, and it has been given the name
of Bruttian pitch; it is only useful for casks and
similar receptacles, and differs from other pitch by its
viscosity and also by its reddish colour and because
it is greasier than all the rest. It is made from pitch-
resin caused to boil by means of red-hot stones in casks
made of strong oak, or, if casks are not available‚ by
piling up a heap of billetS, as in the process of making
charcoal. It is this pitch which is used for seasoning
wine after being beaten up into a powder like flour,
when it has a rather black colour. The same resin,
if rather gently boiled with water and strained off,
becomes viscous and turns a reddish colour3 this is
called ‘ distilled pitch.' For making this the inferior
parts of the resin and the bark of the tree are usually
set aside. Another mixing process produced ‘ in-
toxication resin ⁷: raw flower of resin is picked off
the tree with a quantity of thiu, short chips of the
wood, and broken up small in a sieve, and then
steeped in water heated to boiling‚ The grease of
this that is extracted makes the best quality of resin,
and it is rarely obtainable‚ and only in a few districts
of Italy near the Alps. It is suitable for medical use z
the doctors boil ἓ of a gallon of white resin in 1¹}
gallons of rain-water—though others think it pays
better to boil it without water over a slow fire for a
whole day, and to employ a vessel of white copper,
or to boil resin from the turpentine-tree in a flat pan
on hot ashes, as they prefer this to all the other kinds.
The resin of the mastich is rated next.
