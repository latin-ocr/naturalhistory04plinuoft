because of this in fig-orcliards a goat-fig is allowed to
grow on the windward side, so that when a wind
blows the gnats may fly off and be carried to the fig-
trees. Then a plan was discovered of also bringing
branches of the wild fig from somewhere else and
throwing them tied together in bundles on to the flg-
orchardâ€”a treatment which orchard figs do not
require when planted in a thin soil with a northerly
aspect, since they dry of their own accord owing to
the situation of the place, and this cause by making
them split open produces the same results as the
action of the gnats3 nor yet do they need screening
where there is much dust, which occurs chiefly when
a much frequented high road is adjacent, for dust also
has the effect of drying them up and absorbing the
milky juice. This method by means of the dust and
the employment ofthe wild fig also serves the purpose
of preventing the figs from falling off, by removing
the juice which is soft and heavy, involving a certain
liability to break. All figs are soft to the touch, and
when ripe have grains inside them3 also while in
process of ripening they contain a milky juice, which
when they are quite ripe is of the nature of honey. Impone]
When left on the tree they grow old, and when quite sff-
aged they drip tears of gum. The figs that are
highly approved are given the distinction of being
dried and kept in boxes, the best and largest growing
in the island of Iviza and the next best in the district
of Chieti3 but in places where there is a very large
supply of them, they are packed for storage in large
jars in Asia, but in casks in the city of Ruspina in
Africa, and when dry they serve the purpose of
bread and other viands at the same time, inasmuch as
