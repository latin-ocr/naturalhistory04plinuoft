different way from the giant fennel, as at all events
the elder has more wood3 a shepherd believes that
a horn or trumpet of elder wood will be louder if the
wood was cut in some place where the elder bush is
out of hearing of the crowing of cocks. Brambles
bear blackberries, and one variety, which is called in
Greek the dog-bramble‚ a flower like a rose. A
third kind the Greeks call the Ida bramble, from the
place where it grows, a more slender variety than
the others, with smaller and less hooked thorns;
its blossom is used to make an ointment for sore eyes,
and also, dipped in honey, for St. Anthony's fire,‘²
and also soaked in water it makes a draught to cure
stomach troubles. Elder-trees have small black
berries with a sticky jujce, chiefly used for a hair
dye3 these also are boiled in water and eaten.
LXXII. There is also a juice in the body of trees,
which must be looked upon as their blood. It is
not the same in all trees—in figs it is a milky
substance, which has the property of curdling milk
so as to produce cheese, in cherries it is gummy,
in elms slimy‚ sticky and fat, in apples, vines and
pears watery. The stickier this sap is, the longer
the trees live. And in general the bodies of trees,
as of other living things, have in them skin‚ blood,
flesh, sinews, veins, bones and marrow. The bark
serves for a skin3 it is a remarkable fact as regards
the bark on a mulberry that when doctors require
its juice they strike it with a stone two hours after
sunrise in spring and the jujce trickles out, but if
a deeper wound is made the bark seems to be dry.
Next to the bark most trees have layers of fatty
substance, called from its white colour alburnum ; this
is soft and the worst part of the wood, rotting easily
