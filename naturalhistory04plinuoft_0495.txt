dealing with herbaceous plants. Also near that

LXII. It is said that ivy now grows in Asia [waes

Minor. Theophrastus about 314 B.C. had stated that
it did not grow there, nor yet in India except on
Mount Meros, and indeed that Harpalus had used
every effort to grow it in Media without success, while
Alexander had come back victorious from India with
his army wearing xweaths of ivy, because of its
rarity, in imitation of Father Liber3 and it is even

now used at solemn festivals among the peoples of

Thrace to decorate the wands of that god, and also the
worshippers’ helmets and shields‚ although it is
injurious to all trees and plants and destructive to
tombs and walls, and very agreeable to chilly snakes,
so that it is surprising that any honour has been
paid to it.

There are two primary kinds of ivy, as of the rest
of the plants, the male and the female. The male
is said to have the larger stem and leaf, which also
are harder and have more sap, and so it also has a
larger flower, approaching purple in colour3 but the
flower of both male and female resembles the wild
rose, except that it has no scent. These kinds each
comprise three species, for ivy is white or black and a
third species is called helix. Moreover these species
divide into others, since one kind only has white
fruit but another has a white leaf as well; also in
some of those bearing white fruit the berry is closely
packed and rather large, hanging in round bunches
which are called ‘ clusters,' and also Silenici when the
berry is smaller and the bunch less compact—as
