Others prefer to class this as belonging to a special
kind of tree, and give it the Latin name of carpinus.

XXVII. But a very beautiful feature of the maple
is the growth on it called bruscum, and yet much
more remarkable the molluscum, both knots, the
former veined in a twistier pattern, while the latter
is covered with simplet markings, and if it were
large enough for tables to be made of it would
undoubtedly be preferred to citrus-wood3 but as it
is, except for writing-tablets and veneering on
0011011035,α it is seldom seen in use. Bruscum is also
used for making tables, though they have a darkish
eolour. A similar growth is also found on the alder‚
but it is as far inferior to the others as the alder
itself is to the maple. The male maple flowers
before the female. It must be added that maples
grown in dry places are preferred to those in marshes,
as is also the ease with ash-trees. North of the Alps
grows a tree ὸ making timber that closely resembles
the white ash; its Greek name is the cluster-tree‚
as it bears pods containing kernels, which taste like
a hazel nut.

XXVIII. But a timber rated in the first rank is The cust.
that of the box, which is rarely marked with wrinkles
and only at the root, the rest of it being smooth;
box-wood is esteemed for a certain toughness and
hardness and for its pale colour, while the tree itself
is valued in ornamental gardening. There are three
kinds: the Gallie box, which is trained to shoot up
into conica] pillars and attains a rather large height3
the oleaster, which is condemned for all purposeS,
and which gives out an unpleasant smell; and a
third kind called our native box, a cultivated variety
