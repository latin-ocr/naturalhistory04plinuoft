specd. All the foliage is at the top of the tree, and
so is the fruit, which is not among the leaves as in
all other trees, but hanging in bunches from shoots
of its own between the branches, and which has the
nature of both a cluster and a single fruit. The
leaves have a knife-like edge at the sides and are
divided into two flanges that fold together; they
first suggested folding tablets for writing, but at the
present day they are split up to make ropes and
plaited wicker-work and parasols.

and even grasses, are of both sexes, a fact which it

terms, although in no trees is it more manifest than
in the palm. A male palm forms a blossom on the
shoot, whereas a female merely forms a bud like an
ear of corn, without going on to blossom. In both
male and female, however, the ssesh of the fruit forms
first and the woody core afterwards3 this is the seed
of the tree-——which is proved by the fact that small
fruits without any core are found on the same shoot,
The seed is oblong in shape and not rounded like an
olive-stone, and also it is split at the back by a bulging
cleft, and in most cases shaped like a navel at the
middle of the bulge ε it is from here that the root first
spreads out. In planting the seed is laid front-side
downward, and a pair of seeds are placed close to-

produces a weak plant, but the four shoots unite in
one strong growth. This woody core is divided from
the fleshy parts by a number of white coats, others
clinging closely to its body ; and it is loose and separ-
