foresight in this matter also, has becn rather careless
about bestowing seed on a trce that is propagatcd
easily even from a planted sprig. It is said however
that one variety of willow usually carries its seed till
it ripens; this grows on the island of Crete just by
the path coming down from the Cave ‘¹ of J upiter3

Greece is that the figs grow underneath the leaves,
