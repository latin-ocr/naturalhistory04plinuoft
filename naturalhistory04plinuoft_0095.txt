that of a myrtle3 incision is made in it with a piece
of glass or a stone, or with knives made of bone—it
strongly dislikes having its vital parts wounded with
steel, and dies off at once, though it can stand having
superfluous branches pruned with a steel knife. The
hand of the operator making the incision has to be
poised under skilful control, to avoid inflicting a
wound going below the bark. The juice that oozes
out of the incision is called opobalsamum3 it is ex-

the trickle being collected by means of tufts of wool
in small horns and poured out of them into a new
earthenware vessel to store; it is like rather thick
olive-oil and in the unfermented state is white in
colour3 later on it turns red and at the same time
hardens, having previously been transparent. When
Alexander the Great was campaigning in that coun-

summer to fill a single shell,“ and for the entire
produce of aaerather large garden to be six congii and
of a smaller one congius, at a time moreover when its
price was twice its weight in silver: whereas at the
present day even a single tree produces a larger
flow. The incision is made three times in every
summer, and afterwards the tree is lopped. There
is a market even for the twigs too3 within five years
of the conquest of J udaea the actual loppings and
the shoots fetched 800,000 sesterces. These trim-

down in perfumes, and in manufacture they have
taken the place of the actual juice of the shrub.
Even the bark fetches a price for drugs3 but the
tears are valued most, the seed coming second,
