BOOK XVI. Lxxm. 185—187

grainings in the fibre run crosswise‚ and consequently
even vessels made of beechwood were highly valued
in old days: Manius Curius declared on oath that he
had touched nothing of the booty taken in a battle
except a flask made of beech-wood‚ to use in offering
sacrifices.

A log of timber floats more or less horizontally, Τ mm
each part of it sinking deeper the nearer it was to Jssffffleae
the root. Some timbers have fibre without veins,
consisting of thin filaments merely3 these are the ⁷
easiest to split. Others have no fibre, and break
more qujckly than they split, for instance olives and
vines. But on the other hand in the fig—tree the body
consists entirely of flesh, while the holm-oak‚ cornel,
hard oak, cytisus, mulberry‚ ebony, lotus and the
>trees that we have stated to be without marrow‚§l83.
consist entirely of bone. The timber of all of these
is of a blackish eolour except the cornel, hunting ’
spears made of which are bright yellow when notched
with incisions for the purpose of decoration. The
cedar, the larch and the juniper are red. The
female larch contains wood called in Greek aegis,
of the colour of honey; this wood⁰ when made
into panels for pictures has been found to last for
ever without being split by any cracks ; it is the part
of the trunk nearest to the pith3 in the fir-tree the
Greeks call this ‘lusson.’⁶ The hardest part of
the cedar also is the part nearest the pith—as
the bones are in the body—provided the slimec
has been scraped off. It is reportedd that the
inner part of the elder also is remarkably firm,
and some eople prefer hunting spears made of
it to all ot ers, as it consists entirely of skin and
bones.
