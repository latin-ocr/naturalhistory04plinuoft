not be omitted: it cannot be called either flesh or
wood or cartilage, and it would not be given any
other name.

XXXV. The nature of the juices produced is par-
ticularly remarkable in the case of the myrtle,
because it is the only one among all the trees that
gives two kinds of oil and of wine, beside the drink
called myrtidanum, as we said. In former times
another use was also made of the myrtle-berry,
which held the place of pepper before pepper was
discovered ; in fact, in the case of one kind of savoury
dish the name is derived from this, it being to this
day called myrtle sausage. Also the flavour of wild
boar is improved from the same source, as the pickle
usually has myrtle-berries added to it.

XXXVI. The actual tree is recorded to have been
seen for the first time on the hither side of Europe,
beginning from the Ceraunian Mountains, on the
grave of Elpenor at Circello‚ and it still keeps its Greek
name, showing it to be an exotic. At the time of the
foundation of Rome myrtles grew on the present site
of the city, as tradition says that the Romans and
Sabines, after having wanted to fight a battle because
of the carrying off of the maidens, laid down their
arms and purified themselves with sprigs of myrtle, at
the place now occupied by the statues of Venus
Cluacina‚ cluere being the old word meaning ‘ to
cleanse.' And a kind of incense for fumigation is
also contained in this tree, which was selected for the
purpose on the occasion referred to because Venus the
guardian spirit of the tree also presides over unions,
and I rather think that it was actually the first of
all trees to be plantedin public places at Rome, fraught
indeed with a prophetie and remarkable augury.
