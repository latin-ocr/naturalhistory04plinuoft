up on them, and although alders in hedges give
protection and, if planted rather close together in
water, stand sentry like banks to guard the country
against the assaults of the rivers when they overflow,
and when cut down they are useful because of the
innumerable suckers that they produce as successors.

LXVIII. The uses made of willows are of several
kinds. They send out rods of great length used for
vine-trellises and at the same time provide strips of
bark for withes, and some grow shoots of a yielding
flexibility useful for tying, others extremely thin
ones suitable for weaving into basketwork of an
admirably fine texture, and other stronger ones for
plaiting baskets and a great many agricultural
mensus, while the whiter ones when the bark has
been removed and they have been worked smooth
do to make bottles more capacious than any that
can be made of leather, and also are extremely
suitable for luxurious easy chairs. The willow
sprouts again after being loppcd, and from the short
stump, which is more like a fist than a branch,
makes a thicker growth for cutting, the tree being in
our opinion not one of the last to choose for cultivation,
inasmuch as none yields a safer return or involves
less outlay, and none is more indifferent to weather.

LXIX. Catoa attributes to the willow the third place
in the estimation of the country-side, and puts it before
the cultivation of the olive and before corn or meadow-
land—and this is not because other kinds of withes
are lacking, inasmuch as the broom, the poplar, the
elm, the blood-red cornel, the birch‚ the reed when
split and the leaves of the reed, as in Liguria, and the
vine itself and bramhles after the thorns have been
