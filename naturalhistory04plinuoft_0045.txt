its taste, which dries up the mouth and leaves a
pleasant flavour.

The price of nard is 100 denarii a pound. The
nard-leaf market is graded according to ihc size of
the leaf: the kind called hadrosphaerum in larger
pills costs 40 denarii; the smaller-leaved sort called
mesosphaerum sells at 60 denarii 3 and the most highly
spoken of, microsphaerum, is made of the smallest
leaves and its price is 75 denarii. All the kinds
have an agreeable scent, stronger when they are
fresh. The better nard has a blacker colour, if it
is old when gathered. In our part of the world“
the next most highly praised kind is the Syriam
then that from Gaul, and in the third place is the
Cretan, which some call agrion and others phun ¹²3
it has a leaf like that of alexanderS, a stalk 18 inches
long, knotted and coloured whitish purple, and a
crooked hairy root resembling birds' claws. Wild
nard is called baccaris3 we shall speak about it
among flowers. All of these kinds of nard, however,
are herbs except the Indian. Among them the
Gallie kind is plucked with the root as well, and washed
in wine, dried in 3 shady place, and done up with
paper in small parcels3 it does not differ much from
the Indian nard, but it is lighter in weight than the
Syrian. Its price is 3 denarii. In the case of these
varieties the only way to test them is that the leaves
must not be brittle and parched instead of merely
dry. With Gallie nard there always grows the herb
called ‘little goat' because of its offensive smell,
like the smell of a goat3 it is very much employed
to adulterate nard, from which it is distinguished
by having no stem and smaller leaves, and by its
root, which is not bitter and also has no smell.
