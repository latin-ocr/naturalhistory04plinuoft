And in order that nobody may imagine that it has
gained its position by influence due to distinction and
family, there is also a Sceptian apple named from a
freedman who discovered it, which is remarkable for
its round shape, Cato also mentions a Quirinian
apple, and a Scantian which he says is stored in casks.
But the apple naturalized here most recently of all is
a small one with a most agreeable flavour named the
Petisian. The Amerian and the Little Greek apples

apple was named from its quickness in ripening‚ but
is now called the honey-apple from its honey flavour3
the round apple from its shape, which forms an
exact sphere——the Greeks, who call this apple the
Epirotic apple‚ prove that it was first produced in

resemblance to a teat, and the eunuch-apple of the
Belgians is named from its having no pips. The
leaf-apple has a single leaf, or occasionally a pair of
leaves, sprouting out from the middle of its side ; the
ragged-apple very quickly shrivels up into wrinkles;

are of the colour of blood, because they derive their
origin from a graft of the mulberry ; but all apples are
red in the parts that have been turned towards the

of flavour and an even sharper scent; their special
fault is that of horrible sourness, and it is so
powerful that it will blunt the edge of 3 sword.
Another apple is named ‘flour-apple,' 3 very bad
