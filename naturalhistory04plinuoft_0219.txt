albuelis vine bears more fruit at the top of the
trees that it is grown on, the visulla on the
bottom branches; and consequently, when both
are planted round the same trees, owing to this
difference of habit they produce rich crops. One of
the black grapes has been named ‘the good-for-
nothing,' though it might more properly be styled
‘ the sober‚’ as the wine it produces is admirable,
particularly when old, but though strong it has no ill
effects: in fact this is the only vintage that does not
cause intoxication. All the other kinds of vine have
the recommendation of bearing freely, and chief
among them the helvennaca. Of this there are two
kinds, one larger, which some people call the long
helvennaca, the other smaller, called emarcus3 the
latter is not so prolific but produces a wine of more
agreeable flavour3 it is distinguished by its rounded
leaf, but both kinds have a slender growth. They
require to be supported on forked props, otherwise
they cannot support the weight of their abundant
fruit. They like a sea breeze, and dislike damp dews.
None of the vines love Italy less, for there it grows
leafless and stunted and soon decays, and also the
wine it produces will not keep beyond the summer3
and no other vine is more at home in a thin soil.
Graecinus, who has generally copied Cornelius Celsus,
thinks that it is not the nature of this vine to
which Italy is not friendly but the mode of culti-
vating it, as growers are too eager to make it put
out shoots; the consequence of this, he says, is
that it is used up by its own fertility‚ unless the
bounty of the soil is so rich as to afford it sup-
port when it begins to droop. It is said that this
vine never contracts carbuncle, which is a very
