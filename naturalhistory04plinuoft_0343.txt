should also be wrapped up separately in fig-leaves
(but not leaves that have fallen off) and stored in
wicker baskets or else smeared over with potters’
earth. He says that pears should be stored in earthen-
ware jars which should be covered with pitch and
placed bottom upwards in a hole in the ground with
earth heaped over them. He recommends gathering
the Taranto pear very late 3 and keeping the Anician
and also sorb-apples in raisin wine, and putting them

lid ofthejar plastered up and two feet ofearth heaped
on top of it, the vessels being placed bottom upward 3
and he also recommends hanging them together with
their branches, like grapes, in large jars.

Some of the most recent writers examine deeper Pici-inqsor

should be picked early for the purpose of storage, sor '‘effluv-

morning, in fine weather or with a dry wind blowing.
Likewise they say that the fruit ought to be chosen

berries have been removed with a pair of scissors,
should be hung up inside a fresh-tarred cask, with all
air shut out by the lid and by plaster. They recom-

pears, the stalks of all having been smeared with
pitch. They say that the casks must not be kept
anywhere near water. Some people store them in
this way together with the branch itself, with each of
