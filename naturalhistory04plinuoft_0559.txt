Also a plant that grows on a wild olive after it has
been lopped is called phaunos, while one that grows
on the fuller's teazel is called hippophaestum3 it has
hollow stalks, small leaves and a white root, the juice
of which is considered very useful for purgatives
in epilepsy.

that grows as a parasite on the. fir and the larch is called
steljs in Euboea and hyphear in Arcadia, and the name
of mistletoe is used for one growing on the oak,
hard oak, holm—oak, wild pear, turpentine—tree‚ and

abundance on the oak is one which they call dryos
hyphear. There is a difference in the case of every
tree except the holm· oak and the oak in the smell
and poison of the berry and the disagreeably scented
leaf, both the berry and the leaf of the mistletoe
being bitter and sticky. The hyphear is more useful
than tare for fattening cattle; at first it only acts
as a purge, but it subsequently fattens the beasts
that have stood the purging process, although they
say that those with some interna] malady cannot
stand it. This method of treatment is employed
for forty days in summer. An additional variety is
said to be found in mistletoe, in that when it grows
on deciduous trees it also sheds its leaves itseIf, but
when growing on an evergreen tree it retains its
leaves. But universally when mistletoc seed is
sown it never sprouts at all, and only when passed
in the excrement of birds, particularly the pigeon
and the thrush: its nature is such that it will not
shoot unless it has been ripcned in the stomach of
birds. Its height does not exceed eighteen inches‚
and it is evergreen and always in leaf. The male
