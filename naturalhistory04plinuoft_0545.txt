BOOK XVI. LXXXI. 222-Lxxxn. 225

LXXXI. We have in our country some timbers paramum os
liable to split of their own accord, and architects numbers.
consequently recommend that they should be smeared
with dung and then dried‚ so as to make them proof
against the action of the atmosphere. Fir and larch
are strong weight-carriers‚ even when placed hori-
zontally, and whereas hard oak and olive bend and
yield to a weight, the woods named resist it and
are not readily broken, and they fail owing to rot
before they fail in strength. The palm tree also is
strong, for it curves in a different way to other
trees: all the others curve downward, but the palm
curves in the opposite direction‚‘z making an arch.
Pine and cypress are the strongest to resist rot and
wood-worms. Walnut bends easily—for this wood
also is used for making beams; when it breaks it
gives a warning in advance by a creaking noise, as
happened for instance at Antandro, when people
in the public baths took alarm at the sound and,
made their escape. Pines, pitch pines and alders
are hollowed to form pipes for conveying water, and
when buried underground will last a number of years ;
but they age quickly if not covered over, the resistance
they offer being remarkably increased if their out-
side surface also is covered with moisture.

tion ; it is very suitable for door panels and any kinds
of inlaid work desired, whether in the Greek or the
Campanian or the Sicilian style of joinery3 under
brisk planing it makes pretty curly shavings‚ always
twisting in a spiral like the tendrils of a vine;
moreover, of all sorts of wood it is most adapted
for being glued together, so much so that it will split
at a solid place before it parts at a join.
