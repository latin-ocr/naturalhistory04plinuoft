wound. This is most common with plane trees,
which hold a very large quantity of wind because of
the density of their branches, which are lopped to
relieve the trees of the weight and the trees are then
replanted in their own hole ; and this has before now
also been done in the case of walnuts and olives and
a number of other trees. There are also many cases
of trees having fallen even without a storm or any
other cause except one of a miraculous nature and
having risen up again of their own accord. This
portent occurred to the citizens of the Roman
nation during the Cimbrian wars in the case of an
elm in the grove of J uno at Nocera, actually after its
top had been lopped off because it was leaning
forward right on to the altar3 the tree was restored
of its own accord so completely that it at once
flowered, and from that date onward the majesty of
the Roman people recovered, after having previously
been ravaged by disasters in war. It is recorded
that this also happened at Philippi with a willow
that had fallen down and had been severed from its
trunk, and at Stagira with a white poplar in the shrine
of the Muses, all of these occurrences being of good
omen. But most wonderful of all, 3 plane-trec at
Antandros recovered of its own accord and was
restored to life even after its sides had been rough-
hewn all round, a trec 2251,- feet high and 6 feeta
thick.

LVIII. Those trees which we owe to Nature grow
in three ways, spontaneously or by seed or from a root.
More numerous artificial methods have come into
existence, about which we shall speak in the volume
given to the subject3 for at the present our whole
discourse is about Nature, so memorable for her
