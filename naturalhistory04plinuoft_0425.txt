XV. The most suitable roof-shingles are got from
the hard-oak‚ and the next best from the other acorn—
bearing trees and from the beech; those most easily
obtained are cut from all the trees that produce
resin, but these are the least good to last with the
exception of those from the pine. Cornelius Nepos
informs us that Rome was roofed with shingles right
down to the war with Pyrrhus, a period of 470 years.“
At all events its different regions used to be denoted
by designations taken from the woods ⁶—the Pre-
cinct of Jupiter of the Beech Tree (which retains the
name even to-day)——where there was once a grove of
beeches‚ Oak-forest Gate, Osier Hill‚ where people
went to get osiers, and all the Groves, some even
named from two sorts of trees. It was in VVinter-oak
Grove that Quintus Hortensius as dictator after the
secession of the plebeians to the ,Ianiculum Hill
carried the law that an order of the plebs should
be binding on all citizens.

XVI. The pine and the fir and all the trees that
produce pitch were in those days considered exotics‚
because there were none in the neighbourhood of the
capital. Of these trees we shall now speak, in order
that the whole of the source from which flavouring
for wine is produced may be known at once, after
an account has been given of the trees in Asia or the
East which produce pitch.

In Europe pitch is produced by six kinds of trees,
311 related to one another. Of these the pine and the
wild pine have 3 very narrow long leaf like hair, with
3 sharp point at the end. The pine yields the smallest
amount of resin, sometimes also produced from its
nuts themselves, about which we have spoken, and
scarcely enough to justify its classification as 3 resinous
