it is proper to speak at greater length, as it holds

shrub, the root of which is heavy and thick but
short and black‚ and although oily, brittle3 it has 3

leaves are small, and grow in clusters. The shoots of
the nard sprout into ears, and consequently both the
spikes and the leaves of the nard are famous—a two-

ruddy colour and sweet scent and particularly by
