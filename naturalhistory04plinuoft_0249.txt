nature smacks of the sea ; and that of Mount Tmolus
also is not esteemed as a wine to drink neat, but
because being a sweet wine an admixture of it gives
sweetness to the dry quality of the remaining vin-
tages‚ at the same time also giving them age, as it
at once makes thern seem more mature. Next after
these in esteem are the wines of Sicyon, Cyprus,
Telmesus, Tripoli, Beyrout, Tyre and Sebennys.
This last is grown in Egypt, being made from three
famous kinds of grapes that grow there, the Thasian‚
the soot-grape and the pine-tree grape. Ranking
after these are the wines of Hippodamas, of Mystus
and of the canthareos vine, the protropuma of Cnidos,
and the wines of the volcanic region in Mysia,
of Petra and of Myconos. As for the vintage of
Mesogis, it has been found to cause headache, and
that of Ephesus has also proved to be unwholesome,
because sea-water and boiled must are employed to
season it. Apamea wine is said to be particularly
suitable for making mead, and so likewise is the
Praetutian in Italy—for this too is a property peculiar
to certain kinds of wine: two sweet wines do not
generally go well together. Protagion also has
quite gone out, a wine which the medical profession
had put next to those of Italy. The physician
Apollodorus in his pamphlet advising King Ptolemy
what wines to drink—the Italian vintages being
even then unknown—praised the wine of Nas-
percenc in Pontus, and next to it the Oretic‚
Oeneate, Leucadian, Ambraciote and Peparethian
vintages—-the last he put before all the rest, but
said it was less well thought of on account of its
not being fit to drink before it was six years old.
