others Alexander’s crown. This also is a bushy shrub‚
with a thicker and soster leaf than the ordinary

the berries are a blackish red. The older writers
noted that there was no variety of laurel that grew
in Corsica3 but it has now been introduced there
with successful results.

as to hold out a branch of it even between enemy
armies is a token of a cessation of hostilities. With
the Romans especially it is used as a harbinger of re-
joicing and of victory, accompanying despatches and
decorating the spears and javelins ofthe soldiery and
adorning the generals’ rods of office. From this tree
a branchis deposited in the lap ofJupiter the All-good
and All-great whenever a fresh victory has brought
rejoicing‚ and this is not because the laurel is con-
tinually green, nor yet because it is an emblem of
peace, as the olive is to be preferred to it in both
respects, but because it flourishes in the greatest
beauty on Mount Parnassus and consequently is
thought to be also dear to Apollo, to whose shrine even
the kings of Rome at that early date were in the
custom of sending gifts and asking for oracles in
return, as is evidenced by the case of Brutus3
another reason also is perhaps to supply a token, be-
cause it was there that Brutus won freedom for the
people by kissing the famous plot of earth that bore
the laureL at the direction of the oracular utterance ‘¹ ;
and another possible reason is that the laurel alone
of all the shrubs planted by man and received into our
houses is never struck by lightning. Ι personally am
inclined to believe that it is for these reasons that the
