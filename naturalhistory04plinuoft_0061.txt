BOOK XII. xxxm. 66—xxxv. 68

XXXIII. Some authorities have stated that myrrh Myr-rh: its
is the produci: of a tree growing in the same forests Jssg‘csffji‘ssssd
among the frankincense-trees‚ but the majority say
that it grows separately3 and in fact it occurs in
many places in Arabia, as will appear when we deal
with its varieties. A kind highly spoken of is also
imported from islands, and the Sabaei even cross
the sea to the Cave-dwellers’ Countrya to procure
it. Also a cultivated variety 13 produced which is
much preferred to the wild kind. The plant enjoys
being raked and having the soil round it loosened‚
as it is the better for having its roots cool.

XXXIV. The tree grows to a height of nearly eight
feet; it has thorns on it, and the trunk is hard and
twisted‚ and thicker than that of the frankincense—tree‚
and even thicker at the root than in the remaining
part of it. Authorities state that the bark is smooth
and resembles that of the strawberry-tree‚ and others
that it is rough and prickly3 and they say that the
leaf is that of the olive, but more wrinkled and with
sharp points—though J uba says it is like that of the
alexanders. Some say that it resembles the juniper‚
only that it 13 rougher and bristling with thorns, and
that the leaf 13 rounder but tastes like juniper. Also
there have been writers who have falsely asserted
that the frankincense—tree produces myrrh as well as
frankincense.

XXXV. The myrrh-producing tree also is tapped
twice a year at the same seasons as the frankincense-
tree, but in its case the incisions are made all the way up
from the root to those of the branches that are strong
enough to bear it. But before it is tapped the tree
exudes of its own accord a juice called stacte, which is
the most highly valued of all myrrh. Next after
