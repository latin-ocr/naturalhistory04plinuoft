as I believe of the wild box, which spreads inore
than the others and forms a thick hedge3 it is an
evergrecn‚ and will stand clipping. The box abounds
in the Pyrenees and the Kidros mountains and in
the Berecyntus district, and it grows thickest in
Corsica, where it bears an objectionable blossom,
which causes the bitter taste in Corsican honey3
its seed arouses the aversion of all living creatures.
The box on Mount Olympus in Macedonia makes
as thick a growth as the Corsican, but it is of a low
height. Box loves cold and rugged places3 also in
a fire it is as hard as iron, and is of no use for fuel
or charcoal.

XXIX. Among these and the fruit-bearing trees
a place is given to the elm, because of its timber and
the friendship between it and the vine.ss The Greeks
are acquainted with two kinds of elm: the mountain
elm which makes the larger growth, and the elm of
the plains which grows like a shrub.⁶ Italy gives the
name of Atinian elm to a very lofty kind (and among
these values highest the dry variety, which will
not grow in damp places) 3 3 second kind it calls the
Gallie elm, a third, which has thick-er foliage and
more leaves growing from the same stalk, the Italian
clm, and a fourth, the wild elm. The Atinian 61111
does not bear samara—that is the name for elm seed
—and all the elms are grown from shoots of the
roots‚⁶ but the other kinds also from seed.

XXX. The most notable trees having now been
mentioned, some general facts must be pointed out
concerning all trees. The cedar, the larch, the torch-
pine and the rest of the trees that produce resin
love mountains, and so also do the holly, box, holm-
oak‚ juniper, turpentine-tree‚ poplar‚ mountain ash
