of pure balsam thickens in warm water, settling to
the bottom of the vessel, whereas when adulterated
it floats on the top like oil, and ifit has been tampered
with by using metopium, a white ring forms round it.
The best test of all is that it will cause milk to curdle
and will not leave stains on eloth. In no other case is
more obvious fraud practised, inasmuch as every pint
bought at a sale of confiscated property for 300
denarii when it is sold again makes 1000 denarii: so
much does it pay to increase the quantity of adultera-
tion. The price of wood-balsam is six denarii a pound.

LV. The region of Syria beyond Phoenicia nearest seyraoe

to J udaea produces styrax in the part round Gabala
and Marathus and Mount Casius in Seleucia. The
tree has the same name3 it is similar to a quince. Its
tears have a pleasant, almost pungent scent, and inside
it resembles a reed, and is full of juice. About the
rising of the Dog-star certain little maggots with
wings flutter about this tree, gnawing away the wood,
and consequently it is fouled with their scrapings.
The styrax esteemed next to the above-named
growths comes from Pisidia, Side, Cyprus and Cilicia,
and that from Crete is rated lowest3 that from
Mount Amanus in Syria is valued by the medical
profession, but even more by perfumiers. In every
nation a red colour and sticky consistency are
preferred, and styrax that is brown and covered with
white mould is considered inferior. It is adulterated
m'th cedar α resin or gum, and another way employs
honey or bitter almonds3 all these adulterations can
be detected by their taste. The price of the best
styrax is 17 denarii. It is also produced in Pamphylia,
but this is a drier and less juicy kind.
