berry in foliage, size and appearance3 it bears its
fruit not on the branches but on the trunk itself, and
this is an exceedingly sweet fig without seeds inside
it. There is an extremely prolific yield, but only if
incisions are made in the fruit with iron hooks, other-
wise it does not ripen3 but when this is done, it can
be plucked three days later, another fig forming in
its place, the tree thus scoring seven crops of ex-
tremely juicy figs in a summer. Even if the incisions
are not made new fruit forms under the old and drives
out its predecessor before it is ripe four times in a
summer. The wood of this fig is of a peculiar
kind, and is one of the most useful there is. As soon
as it is cut it is plunged into a marsh, and at first
sinks to the bottom, but afterwards begins to float,
and it is clear that moisture not belonging to it,
which soaks into all other timber, drains the sap out
of this. When it begins to float on the surface,
this is its sign that the timber is ready for use.

XV. A tree to some extent resembling the Egyptian
fig is one in Crete called the Cyprian fig, as it also
bears fruit on its actual trunk and on its branches
when they have grown to thickness. But the Cyprian
fig puts out a bud without any leaves, resembling a
root. The trunk of the tree is like a poplar, and the
leaf like an elm. It bears fruit four times a year,
and also buds the same number of times, but its
unripe figs will not ripen unless an incision is made in
them to let out the juice. Tbey have the sweet taste
and the inside of the common fig, and are the size of
a service—tree berry.

XVI. Another similar tree is the one called by St. John’s

the Ionians the ceronia, which also buds from the
trunk, the fruit being a pod, which has consequently
