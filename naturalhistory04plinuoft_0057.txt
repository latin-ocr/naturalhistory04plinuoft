people also think that a better kind is produced on
islands‚ but J uba says that no incense grows on
islands at all.

Frankincense that hangs suspended in a globular Mal?
drop we call male frankincense, although in other sran aucense.
connexions the term ‘ male ’ is not usually employed
where there is no female 3 but it is said to have been
due to religious scruple that the name of the other
sex was not employed in this case. Some people
think that male frankincense is so called from its
resemblance to the testes. The frankincense most
esteemed, however, is the breast-shaped, formed
when, while a previous drop is still hanging suspended,
another one following unites with it. I find it
recorded that one of these lumps used to be a whole
handful, in the days when men's eagerness to pluck
them was less greedy and they were allowed to
form more slowly. The Greek name for frankincense
formed in this manner is ‘drop-incense ’ or ‘solid
incense‚’ and for the smaller kind ‘ chick-pea
incense '3 the fragments knocked off by striking the
tree we call manna. Even at the present day, how-
ever, drops are found that weigh as much as a third
of a mina‚“ that is 28 denarii. Alexander the Great
in his boyhood was heaping frankincense on the altars
in lavish fashion, when his tutor Leonides told him
that he might worship the gods in that manner when
he had conquered the frankincense—producing races3
but when Alexander had wonb Arabia he sent Leonides
a ship with a cargo of frankincense, with a message
charging him to worship the gods without any stint.

Frankincense after being collected is conveyed to Tran.5p0rc0f
Sabota on camels, one of the gates of the city being {ffifflfffjssf
opened for its admission3 the kings have made it a tem-aman.
