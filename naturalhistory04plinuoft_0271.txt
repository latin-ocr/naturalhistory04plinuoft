the root of which is added in the proportion of
50 drams to 6 pints of must, after being similarly

wormwood wine is made by boiling down a pound of
Pontic wormwood in five gallons of must to one-third

from lavender and from gentian root and goat-
marjoram and dittany, hazelwort, carrot, sage‚ all-
heal, acorus, thyme‚ mandragora, and sweet rush.
There is also mention of scyzinum and itaeomelis
and lectisphagites, for which the recipe is now lost.
