grape, and such small clusters that it does not pay
to grow it except in a very rich soil. The eugenia,
with its name denoting high quality, has been im-
ported from the hills of Taormina to be grown only
in the territory of Alba, as if transplanted else-
where it at once degenerates: for in fact some vines
have so strong an affection for certain localities that
they leave all their reputation behind there and
cannot be transplanted elsewhere in their full vigour.
T his occurs also with the Rhaetian and Allobrogian
grapes-the latter the grape with the flavour of pitch
which we mentioned above—which are famous at §18-
home but not worth recognition elsewhere. All the
same, being good hearers they make up in quantity
what they lack in quality, the eugenia grape in
warm localities, the Raetic in those with a moderate
climate and the Allobrogian in cold districts, 35 it
ripens in frost and has a black colour. The wines
made from the grapes so far mentioned, even from
the black ones, turn to a white colour with age.
The remaining vines are of no quality, although
occasionally owing to the agency of climate or soil
they are not disappointing when old, as in the case
of the Faecenian vine, and that of Bourges⁰ which
blossoms at the same time but has fewer grapes ; their
blossom is never liable to inj ury, 35 they do not come
before the west wind of early spring and can with-
stand wind and rain, although they do better in cold
places than in warm ones and in damp situations than
in dry. The visulla⁶ bears clusters of large size rather
than closely packed; it cannot stand changes of
weather, but lasts well against a continuous spell of
cold or heat. The smaller variety of this kind is the
better one. It is difficult to please in choice of soil,
