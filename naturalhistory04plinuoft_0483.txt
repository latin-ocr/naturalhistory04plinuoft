branch. With all trees the parts nearest the ground
are thicker. The fir, the lareh‚ the palm, the
cypress, the elrn and all the trees with a single trunk
make their growth in the direction of height.
Among the branching trees the cherry is found
making timbers as much as 20 yards long and a yard
thick for the whole length. Some trees spread out
into branehes at once, for example apples.

LV. The bark of some trees is thin, as in the Varieeissos
laurel and the lime, that of others thick, as in the oak ; '’w‘’
in some it is smooth, as in the apple and the fig,
but it is rough in the oak and the palm, and in all
trees it becomes more wrinkled in old age. With
certain trees, for instance the vine, it bursts of its
own accord, while certain others actually shed their
bark, for instance the apple and the arbutus. The
bark of the cork-tree and the poplar is fleshy, that
of the vine and the reed is like a skin3 in the cherry
it resembles the layers of the papyrus3 the skin of
the vine, the lime and the fu· consists of a number
of coatS, but in some cases it is a single layer, for
instance in the fig and the reed.

LVI. There is also a great difference in the roots of Varieeies of
trees: those of the fig, the hard-oak and the plane ξζξᾶᾗζρῇωκ
are abundant, those of the apple short and thin,
those of the fir and larch single, as these trees are
supported by a single root, although it throws out
small fibres laterally. The roots of the laurel are
rather thick and of uneven shape, and the same with
the olive, the roots of which also form branches‚ but
those of the hard-oak are fleshy. Hard-oaks drive
their roots down deep, indeed the winter oak, at all
events if we believe V irgil, goes down as deep with eman.
