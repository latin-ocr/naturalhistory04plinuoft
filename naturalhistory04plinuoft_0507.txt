them, and is also thinner in itsclf. But another
kind of cane is hollow for its whole length3 its
Greek name means the flute-reed, and it is very
useful for making flutes because it contains no pith
and no fleshy substance. The Orchomenus cane
has a passage right through even the knots, and is
called in Greek the pipe·reed; this is more suitable
for flageolets‚ as the preceding kind is for flutes.
There is another reed the wood of which is thicker
and the passage narrow3 this reed is entirely filled
with spongy pith. Reeds are of various lengths
and thickness. The one called the donax throws
out most shoots; it only grows in watery places—-
inasmuch as this also constitutes a difference, a
reed growing in dry places being much preferred.
The reed used as an arrow is a special kind, as we
have said, but the Cretan variety has the longest 5161·
intervals between the knots, and when heated allows
itself to be bent in any direction you please. Also
differences are made by the leaves, which vary not
only in number and length but also in colour. The
Laconian reed has spotted leaves, and throws out a
greater number at the bottom of the stalk, as is
thought to be the case with reeds in general that
grow round marshy pools‚ which are different from
river reedS‚ being draped with long leaves climbing
upward and embracing the stem for a considerable
distance above the knot. There is also a slanting
reed which does not shoot upward to any height but
spreads itself out close to the ground like a shrub;
it is very attractive to animals when young and tender,
and is called by some people the eletia. Also in Italy
there is a growth, found in marsh-reeds, only coming
out of the outer skin just below the tuft, named
