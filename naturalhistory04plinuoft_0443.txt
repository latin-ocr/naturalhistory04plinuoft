peeled off cannot bc bent; nor does the male tree
produce seed or a flower as thc female does, and the
female is thicker in the trunk and its wood is white
and of superior quality. A remarkable fact in
regard to the lime is that no animal will touch its
fruit, whereas the juice of the leaves and bark has a
sweet taste. Between the bark and the wood there
are thin coats made by a number of layers of skin,
made from which are the ropes called lime-withieS‚⁰
and the thinnest part of them provided lime-
chaplets, famous for the ribbons of wreaths of honour
in old times. Lime—wood is worm-proof‚ and it
makes useful timber although the tree is of extremely
moderate height.

XXVI. The maple, which is of about the same size The maple:
as the lime, is second only to the citrus in its elegance gssssri-‘gffigssd
as a material for cabinet-making and in the finish
it allows of. It is of several kinds: the white
maple, an exceptionally light-coloured wood, is
called Gallie maple, and grows in Italy north of the
Po, and on the other side of the Alps; the second
kind has blotches running in wavy lines, and in its
finer variety has received the nameb of ‘ peacock
maple ’ from its resemblance to a peacock's tan,
the finest sorts growing in Istria and Tyrol; and an
inferior valiety is called the thick- veined maple.
The Greeks distinguish the varieties by locality,
saying that the maple of the plains is light- -coloured
and not wavy—this kind they call glinon—but the
mountain maple has a rather wavy grain and is
harder, the wood of the male tree being still wavier
and suitable for making more elegant articles ; while
a third kind is the hornbeam, a reddish wood that
splits easily, with a rough bark of a pale colour.
