is used—otherwise it produces too bitter a flavour.
Unguent of cyprus produces a green colour, lily
unguent gives a greasy consistency, oil of Mendes
makes the mixture black, attar of roses white, and
myrrh gives a pale hue.

These are the kinds of perfumes invented in early
times, and the subsequent pilferings of the factories.
We will now speak of what is the very climax of luxury
and the most important example of this commodity.

What then is called the ‘ royal ' unguent, because ‘Roval'
it is a blend prepared for the kings of Parthia, is persume.
made of behen-nut juice, costus, amomum, Syrian
cinnamon, cardamom, spikenard, cat-thyme‚ myrrh,
cinnamon-bark, styrax—tree gum, ladanum, balm,

Syrian flag and Syrian rush, wild grape, cinnamon-
leaf, serichatum, cyprus, camel's thorn, all-heal, saff-

none of the components of this scent is grown in
Italy, the conqueror of the world, and indeed none q

and nard in Gaul—for as to wine and roses and
myrtle leaves and olive oil, they may be taken as
belonging to pretty well all countries in common.

III. What are called sprinkling powders are made Howto keep
of dried scents, the dregs of unguents being termed wem·
‘ magma.' Among all the scents employed the one
added last is the most powerful. Unguents keep
best in alabaster boxes, scents when mixed with oil,
and the fatter it is, as for instance oil of almonds‚
the better it helps to preserve them for a long time3
and the unguents themselves improve with age.
Sunshine is detrimental to them, and therefore they
are stored in the shade, in vessels made of lead.
