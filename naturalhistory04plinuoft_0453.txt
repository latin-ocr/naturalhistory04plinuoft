Between the evei-green and the dcciduous classes
are the andrachle growing in Greece and the arbutus
in all countries, for they shed all their leaves except
those on the top of the 'si-‚ee ln the class of shrubs Ετ ziocept naz

shcd their leaves. In the territory of Thurii, where ‘1⁶’ 0²d²⁴0²⁴⁸
Sybaris once stood, there was a single oak that was er.ees
visible from the actual city which never shed its
leaves and which did not bud before midsummer3
and it is surprising that this fact having been pub-
lished by Greek authors has never subsequently
been mentioned among ourselves. The fact is that
the influence of some localities is so great that in the
neighbourhood of Memphis in Egypt and at Elephan-
tine in the Thebaid none of the trees shed their
leaves, not even the vines,

XXXIV. All the rest of the trees except those Dee ciduous
already mentioned—for it would be a lengthy business&
to enumerate them—shed thei1 leaves; and it has
been noticed that the leav es do not wither unless they
are thin, broad and soft‚ whereas the leaves which
do not fall off are thick and fleshy and narrow in
shape. It is an erroneous classification to say that
the trees which do not shed their leaves are those with
a more unctuous juice3 for who can detect that
property in the case of the holm-oak? The mathe-
matician Timaeus thinks that they fall when the sun
is passing through Scorpio owing to the strength of
that constellation and a certain poison in the air;
but then we may justly wonder why the same in-
fluence is not operative against all these trees,
Most trees shed their leaves in autumn, but some lose
them later, and prolong the delay into the winter3
