all diseases. He also recommends a potion made of
cytisus dried and boiled in water to be given with
wine to nursing women when their milk fails, and
he says this will make the infants stronger and
taller3 also he advises giving it while in the green
state to fowls, or if it has dried‚ after being steeped.
Moreover, Democritus and Aristomachus promise
that bees will never fail if there is cytisus available
for them to feed on. No other fodder is less expen-

like leek, if the seed is used3 or else the stalk is
planted in autumn before the winter solstice. If
sown the seed is soaked, or, if there is a shortage of
rain, it is watered after sowing. then the plants
are 18 inches high they are replanted in a trench a
foot deep. This planting is done through the
equinoxes‚ while the shrub is still tender3 it takes
three years to mature, and it is cut at the spring
equinox, when it has done flowering—a job that

woman. It is of a whitish colour to look at, and
its appearance may be briefly described by saying
that it looks like a trifoliated plant with a rather
narrow leaf. It is always fed to stock only once in
two days, but in winter as it has got dry it is moistened

and for smaller animals in proportion. Incidentally‚
good results are got by sowing gai-lic and onions
as catch-crops between the rows of cytisus.

The cytisus shrub was discovered in the island of
Cythnus, and from there was transplanted to all the
Cy clades and later to the Greek csties, greatly increas-

makes me very much surprised that it is rare in Italy-—
