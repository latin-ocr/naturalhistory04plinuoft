shady places has a rougher appearance, and presents
an offensive odour; and pitch in a cold winter is
inferior in quality and less plentiful in quantity,
and of a bad colour. Some people think that the
liquid obtained in mountain regions is superior in
quantity and colour and sweeter, and also has a
more agreeable smell, so long as it remains in the
state of resin, but that when boiled down it yields
less pitch, because it goes off into a watery residue,
and that the trees themselves are thinner than those
in the plains, but that both the one and the other
kinds are less productive in dry weather. Some
trees yield a liberal supply in the year after they
are cut, whereas others do so a year later and some
two years later. The wound fills up with resin,
not with bark or by a scab, as in this tree an incision
in the bark does not join up.

Among these classes of trees some people have
made a special variety of the sappinus fir, because
under the name of this group of trees is grown the

the advertisement given it by Homera as supplying
the spear of Achilles. The wood of the ash is useful
