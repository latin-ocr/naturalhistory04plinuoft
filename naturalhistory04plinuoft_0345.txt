casks still containing wine, but taking care that the
grapes do not touch the wine3 some store apples
floating in wine in earthenware dishes‚ by which
method they think a scent is given to thern by the
wine. Some prefer to preserve all fruit of this kind
in‘millet, but most people think it is best kept in a
hole in the ground two feet deep with a layer of
sand under the fruit and covered with an earthen-
ware lid and then with soil. Some even smear
grapes with potters’ clay, dry thern in the sun
and hang them up, uashing off the clay when
they are orequired for use. In the case of fruits,
they get rid of the clay by means of wine. By the
same method they coat the finest kind of apples w ith
plaster ‘or wax, but if the fruit is not already ripe it
breaks the coating by growing in size3 but they
always store the apples with their stalks downward.
Other people pluck the apples together with the
branches‚ the ends of which they thrust into elder
pith and then bury, as described above. Othersges.

the fruit, packed in flocks of wool, in cases which they
smear with clay mixed with chaff3 others follow the
same plan using earthenware pans to put them in;
and also some store them in a hole on a layer of
sand, and so later cover them up with dry earth.
There are some who give quinees a coat of Pontic
wax and then dip thern in honey. Columella
recommends storing grapes in earthenware vessels
that have been very carefully smeared with a
coating of pitch, and sinking them into wells or
