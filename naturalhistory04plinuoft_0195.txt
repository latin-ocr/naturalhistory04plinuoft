out and ships are moored to them, as well as to their
roots when the tide goes out. We have been in-

have been observed in the same sea which always
keep their leaves and have a fruit resembling a lupine.

J uba relates that in the neighbourhood of the
Cave—dwellers' Islands a bush grows at the bottom
of the sea called ‘hair of Isis,' which has no leaves
and resembles coral, and that when it is lopped it
changes its colour to black and turns hard, and when
it falls it breaks; and so does another marine bush
the Greek name for which means ‘ the Graces’
cyelid‚’ which is a potent love—charm3 he says
women make bracelets and necklaces of it. He
declares that when being taken the bush is aware of
it and turns as hard as horn, blunting the edge of the
knife, but that if it is cut before it is aware of the
danger that threatens it, it turns into stone.
