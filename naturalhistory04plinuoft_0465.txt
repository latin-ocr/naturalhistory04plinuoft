although in trees excessive budding tends to exhaust
the sap; but some trees have other buddings by
natur,e in addition to that w hich takes place 1n spring,
these being settled by their own constellations (an
account of u hich will be given more appropriately
in the next volume but one after this)—a winter XVIII.
budding at the rising of Aquila, a summer one at the ²⁰¹ ff·
rising of the Dog-star and a third at the rising of
Arcturus. Some people think that the two latter
buddings are common to all trees, but that they are
most noticeable in the fig, the vine and the pome-
granate3 and they explain this as due to the fact
that those are the times when there is the most
abundant crop of figs in Thessaly and Macedonia;
although this explanation holds good most clearly in
Egypt. Also whereas the rest of the trees, as soon
as they have begun to bud, keep on budding con-
tinuously‚ the hard-oak‚ the fir and the larch divide
the process into three parts and produce their
buds in three batches; consequently they also
shed scales of bark three times, a process which
occurs in all trees during germination because
the bark of the pregnant tree is burst open. But
their first budding is at the beginning of spring and
takes about a fortnight, while they bud for the second
time when the sun is passing through the Twins,
with the consequence that the first shoots are seen
to be pushed up by those that follow, the growth being
attached by a joint. The third budding period of
the same trees, which starts from midsummer‚ is the
shortest‚ and does not take more than a week3
and on this occasion also the jointing on the tips as
they grow out is clearly visible. Only the vine buds
twice, first when it puts forth a cluster and then
