people neglect—that of colour, for the sake of which
cinnabar α and alkanet should be added. A sprinkle
of salt serves to preserve the properties of the oil, but
to scents containing an admixture of alkanet salt is
not added. Resin or gum are added to retain the
scent in the solid part, as it evaporates and disappears
very quickly if these are not added.

The unguent most quickly made and probably the Various
first invented was made of bryon and behen-oil, Ξξζζᾝξξ
