Marmarica,a is injurious to the womb. Also the
Apulian caper-trec produces vomiting and diarrhoea
by causing flatulence in all the organS. Some
persons call this shrub ‘dog—brier,’ others ‘snake-
vlne.

XLV. The saripha growing on the banks of the
Nile also belongs to the shrub class. It is about 3 ft.
high and the thickness of a man's thumb; its foliage
is that of the papyrus, and it is chewed in a similar §72-

Babylon is grown on thorn-bushes, because it will not
live anywhere else—j ust as mistletoe grows on treeS,
but the plant in question will only grow on what is
called the ‘ royal thorn.' It is a remarkable fact
that it buds on the same day as it has been planted—
this is done just at the rising of the Dogstar—and it
very quickly takes possession of the whole of the
tree. It is used in making spiced wine, and is
cultivated for that purpose. This thorn also grows
on the Long Walls at Athens.

XLVII. T here is also a shrub called cytisus,c which The cytisus.

Athens as a fodder for all kinds of cattle, and when
dried for swine as well, and hc guarantees a yearly
return of 2000 sesterces for an iugerum of it, even
on only moderate soil. It serves the same purpose
as vetch, but produces satiety more quickly‚ an
animal being fattened by quite a moderate amount—-
so much so that beasts of burden fed on it refuse
barley. No other fodder produces a larger quantity
or a better quality of milk, and above everything as
a medicine for cattle it renders them immune from
