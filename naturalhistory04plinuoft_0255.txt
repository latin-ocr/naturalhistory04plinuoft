casks, they plunge the casks in water till midwinter
passes and regular cold weather sets in. There is
moreover another kind of raisin-wine known in the
Province of N arbonne, and there particularly to the
Vocontii, under the name of ‘ sweet wine.' For the
purpose of this they keep the grape hanging on the
vine for an exceptional time, with the foot-stalk
twisted. Some make an incision in the actual shoot
as far as the pith and others leave thc grapes to dry
on tiled roofs, the grapes in all cases being those from
the helvennaca vine. To these some add a wine called
in Greek ‘ strained wine,' to make which the grapes
are dried in the sun for seven days raised seven feet
from the ground on hurdles, in an enclosed place
where at night they are protected from damp; on
the eighth day they are trodden out, and this process
produces a wine of extremely good bouquet and
flavour. Another wine of the sweet class is called
honey-wine ; it differs from mead because it is made
from must, in the proportion of thirty pints of must
of a dry quality to six pints of honey and a cup of
salt, this mixture being brought just to the boil;
this produces a dry-flavoured liquor. But among
these varieties ought also to be placed the liquor
called in Greek protropmn‚⁰ the name given by
some people to must that flows down of its own
accord before the grapes are trodden. This as
soon as it flows is put into special flagons and allowed
to ferment, and afterwards left to dry for forty days
of the summer that follows, just at the rise of the
Dog-star.
XII. The liquors made from grape—skins soaked in After-wines,

water, called by the Greeks seconds and by Cato and
ourselves after-wine, cannot rightly be styled wines,
